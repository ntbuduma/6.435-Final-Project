The new direction in Maya archaeology is toward achieving a
 greater understanding of people and their roles and their relations in
 the past. To answer emerging humanistic questions about ancient
 people's lives Mayanists are increasingly making use of new and
 existing scientific methods from archaeology and other disciplines.
 Maya archaeology is bridging the divide between the humanities and
 sciences to answer questions about ancient people previously considered
 beyond the realm of archaeological knowledge.

Analysis of genetic variation among modern individuals is
 providing insight into prehistoric events. Comparisons of levels and
 patterns of genetic diversity with the predictions of models based on
 archeological evidence suggest that the spread of early farmers from
 the Levant was probably the main episode in the European population
 history, but that both older and more recent processes have left
 recognizable traces in the current gene pool.

Recent advances in cDNA and oligonucleotide DNA arrays have made it
 possible to measure the abundance of mRNA transcripts for many genes
 simultaneously. The analysis of such experiments is nontrivial because
 of large data size and many levels of variation introduced at different
 stages of the experiments. The analysis is further complicated by the
 large differences that may exist among different probes used to
 interrogate the same gene. However, an attractive feature of
 high-density oligonucleotide arrays such as those produced by
 photolithography and inkjet technology is the standardization of chip
 manufacturing and hybridization process. As a result, probe-specific
 biases, although significant, are highly reproducible and predictable,
 and their adverse effect can be reduced by proper modeling and analysis
 methods. Here, we propose a statistical model for the probe-level data,
 and develop model-based estimates for gene expression indexes. We also
 present model-based methods for identifying and handling
 cross-hybridizing probes and contaminating array regions. Applications
 of these results will be presented elsewhere.

2-Aminopurine (2AP) is a fluorescent analog of guanosine and
 adenosine and has been used to probe nucleic acid structure and
 dynamics. Its spectral features in nucleic acids have been interpreted
 phenomenologically, in the absence of a rigorous electronic description
 of the context-dependence of 2AP fluorescence. Now, by using
 time-dependent density functional theory, we describe the excited-state
 properties of 2AP in a B-form dinucleotide stacked with guanosine,
 adenosine, cytosine, or thymine. Calculations predict that 2AP
 fluorescence is quenched statically when stacked with purines, because
 of mixing of the molecular orbitals in the ground state. In contrast,
 quenching is predicted to be dynamic when 2AP is stacked with
 pyrimidines, because of formation of a low-lying dark excited state.
 The different quenching mechanisms will result in different
 experimentally measured fluorescence lifetimes and quantum yields.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe muscle wasting
 disease arising from defects in the dystrophin gene, typically nonsense
 or frameshift mutations, that preclude the synthesis of a functional
 protein. A milder, allelic version of the disease, Becker muscular
 dystrophy, generally arises from in-frame deletions that allow
 synthesis of a shorter but still semifunctional protein. Therapies to
 introduce functional dystrophin into dystrophic tissue through either
 cell or gene replacement have not been successful to date. We report an
 alternative approach where 2′-O-methyl antisense
 oligoribonucleotides have been used to modify processing of the
 dystrophin pre-mRNA in the mdx mouse model of DMD. By
 targeting 2′-O-methyl antisense oligoribonucleotides to
 block motifs involved in normal dystrophin pre-mRNA splicing, we
 induced excision of exon 23, and the mdx nonsense
 mutation, without disrupting the reading frame. Exon 23 skipping was
 first optimized in vitro in transfected
 H-2Kb-tsA58 mdx myoblasts and
 then induced in vivo. Immunohistochemical staining
 demonstrated the synthesis and correct subsarcolemmal localization of
 dystrophin and γ-sarcoglycan in the mdx mouse after
 intramuscular delivery of antisense oligoribonucleotide:liposome
 complexes. This approach should reduce the severity of DMD by allowing
 a dystrophic gene transcript to be modified, such that it can be
 translated into a Becker-dystrophin-like protein.

The regeneration of pancreatic islet β cells is important
 for the prevention and cure of diabetes mellitus. We
 have demonstrated that the administration of poly(ADP-ribose)
 synthetase/polymerase (PARP) inhibitors such as nicotinamide to 90%
 depancreatized rats induces islet regeneration. From the regenerating
 islet-derived cDNA library, we have isolated Reg
 (regenerating gene) and demonstrated that Reg protein induces β-cell
 replication via the Reg receptor and ameliorates experimental diabetes.
 However, the mechanism by which Reg gene is activated in
 β cells has been elusive. In this study, we found that the combined
 addition of IL-6 and dexamethasone induced the expression of
 Reg gene in β cells and that PARP inhibitors enhanced
 the expression. Reporter gene assays revealed that the −81 ≈
 −70 region (TGCCCCTCCCAT) of the Reg gene promoter is a
 cis-element for the expression of Reg
 gene. Gel mobility shift assays showed that the active transcriptional
 DNA/protein complex was formed by the stimulation with IL-6 and
 dexamethasone. Surprisingly, PARP bound to the
 cis-element and was involved in the active
 transcriptional DNA/protein complex. The DNA/protein complex
 formation was inhibited depending on the autopoly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of
 PARP in the complex. Thus, PARP inhibitors enhance the DNA/protein
 complex formation for Reg gene transcription and
 stabilize the complex by inhibiting the autopoly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of
 PARP.

The minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) proteins 2–7 are required for
 both the initiation and elongation steps of chromosomal DNA
 replication. Previous studies have shown that the Mcm complex
 consisting of the Mcm 4, 6, and 7 proteins contains 3′ to 5′ DNA
 helicase activity with limited processivity (displacing duplex DNA
 regions up to 30 nt). In this report, we show that the presence of both
 5′ and 3′ single-stranded tails in DNA helicase substrates is essential
 for the processive helicase activity of the Mcm complex. The presence
 of both 5′ and 3′ tails facilitated the formation of double
 heterohexameric complexes of Mcm4/6/7 on substrate DNA, which
 appeared to be essential for the processive helicase activity. The
 double heterohexameric complex of Mcm4/6/7, in the presence of a
 single-strand DNA binding protein, is capable of unwinding duplex DNA
 region of about 600 bp in length. These results support the hypothesis
 that the Mcm4/6/7 complex can function as a replication helicase.

Infections with parasitic helminths are important causes of
 morbidity and mortality worldwide. New drugs that are parasite specific
 and minimally toxic to the host are needed to counter these infections
 effectively. Here we report the finding of a previously unidentified
 compound, nafuredin, from Aspergillus niger. Nafuredin
 inhibits NADH-fumarate reductase (complexes I + II) activity, a unique
 anaerobic electron transport system in helminth mitochondria, at nM
 order. It competes for the quinone-binding site in complex I and shows
 high selective toxicity to the helminth enzyme. Moreover, nafuredin
 exerts anthelmintic activity against Haemonchus
 contortus in in vivo trials with sheep. Thus,
 our study indicates that mitochondrial complex I is a promising target
 for chemotherapy, and nafuredin is a potential lead compound as an
 anthelmintic isolated from microorganisms.

RNase E isolated from Escherichia coli is contained
 in a multicomponent “degradosome” complex with other proteins
 implicated in RNA decay. Earlier work has shown that the C-terminal
 region of RNase E is a scaffold for the binding of degradosome
 components and has identified specific RNase E segments necessary for
 its interaction with polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), RhlB RNA
 helicase, and enolase. Here, we report electron microscopy studies that
 use immunogold labeling and freeze–fracture methods to show that
 degradosomes exist in vivo in E. coli as
 multicomponent structures that associate with the cytoplasmic membrane
 via the N-terminal region of RNase E. Whereas PNPase and enolase are
 present in E. coli in large excess relative to RNase E
 and therefore are detected in cells largely as molecules unlinked to
 the RNase E scaffold, immunogold labeling and biochemical analyses show
 that helicase is present in approximately equimolar amounts to RNase E
 at all cell growth stages. Our findings, which establish the existence
 and cellular location of RNase E-based degradosomes in
 vivo in E. coli, also suggest that RNA
 processing and decay may occur at specific sites within cells.

Metal-catalyzed oxidation results in loss of function and
 structural alteration of proteins. The oxidative process affects a
 variety of side amino acid groups, some of which are converted to
 carbonyl compounds. Spectrophotometric measurement of these moieties,
 after their reaction with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, is a simple,
 accurate technique that has been widely used to reveal increased levels
 of protein carbonyls in aging and disease. We have initiated studies
 aimed at elucidating the chemical nature of protein carbonyls. Methods
 based on gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with isotopic dilution
 were developed for the quantitation of glutamic and aminoadipic
 semialdehydes after their reduction to hydroxyaminovaleric and
 hydroxyaminocaproic acids. Analysis of model proteins oxidized
 in vitro by Cu2+/ascorbate revealed that
 these two compounds constitute the majority of protein carbonyls
 generated. Glutamic and aminoadipic semialdehydes were also detected in
 rat liver proteins, where they constitute ≈60% of the total protein
 carbonyl value. Aminoadipic semialdehyde was also measured in protein
 extracts from HeLa cells, and its level increased as a consequence of
 oxidative stress to cell cultures. These results indicate that glutamic
 and aminoadipic semialdehydes are the main carbonyl products of
 metal-catalyzed oxidation of proteins, and that this reaction is a
 major route leading to the generation of protein carbonyls in
 biological samples.

We describe a rapid and general technology working entirely
 in vitro to evolve either the affinity or the stability
 of ligand-binding proteins, depending on the chosen selection pressure.
 Tailored in vitro selection strategies based on ribosome
 display were combined with in vitro diversification by
 DNA shuffling to evolve either the off-rate or thermodynamic stability
 of single-chain Fv antibody fragments (scFvs). To demonstrate the
 potential of this method, we chose to optimize two proteins already
 possessing favorable properties. A scFv with an initial affinity of 1.1
 nM (koff at 4°C of 10−4
 s−1) was improved 30-fold by the use of off-rate
 selections over a period of several days. As a second example, a
 generic selection strategy for improved stability exploited the
 property of ribosome display that the conditions can be altered under
 which the folding of the displayed protein occurs. We used decreasing
 redox potentials in the selection step to select for molecules stable
 in the absence of disulfide bonds. They could be functionally expressed
 in the reducing cytoplasm, and, when allowed to form disulfides again,
 their stability had increased to 54 kJ/mol from an initial value of
 24 kJ/mol. Sequencing revealed that the evolved mutant proteins had
 used different strategies of residue changes to adapt to the selection
 pressure. Therefore, by a combination of randomization and appropriate
 selection strategies, an in vitro evolution of protein
 properties in a predictable direction is possible.

A functional human NADH-dependent cytochrome P450 system has been
 developed by altering the cofactor preference of human NADPH cytochrome
 P450 reductase (CPR), the redox partner for P450s. This has been
 achieved by a single amino acid change of the conserved aromatic amino
 acid Trp-676, which covers the re-side of the FAD isoalloxazine ring in
 the nicotinamide-binding site. Of the mutations made, the substitution
 of Trp-676 with alanine (W676A) resulted in a functional NADH-dependent
 enzyme, which catalyzed the reduction of cytochrome c
 and ferricyanide as well as facilitated the metabolism of
 7-ethoxyresorufin by CYP1A2. Kinetic analysis measuring cytochrome
 c activity revealed that the NADH-dependent
 kcat of W676A is equivalent (90%) to the
 NADPH-dependent kcat of the wild-type
 enzyme, with W676A having an approximately 1,000-fold higher
 specificity for NADH. The apparent
 KMNADPH and
 KMNADH values of W676A are 80- and
 150-fold decreased, respectively. In accordance with structural data,
 which show a bipartite binding mode of NADPH, substitution of Trp-676
 does not affect 2′-AMP binding as seen by the inhibition of both
 wild-type CPR and the W676A mutant. Furthermore, NADPH was a potent
 inhibitor of the W676A NADH-dependent cytochrome c
 reduction and CYP1A2 activity. Overall, the results show that Trp-676
 of human CPR plays a major role in cofactor discrimination, and
 substitution of this conserved aromatic residue with alanine results in
 an efficient NADH-dependent cytochrome P450 system.

Trichostatin A (TSA) and trapoxin (TPX) are potent inhibitors of
 histone deacetylases (HDACs). TSA is proposed to block the catalytic
 reaction by chelating a zinc ion in the active-site pocket through its
 hydroxamic acid group. On the other hand, the epoxyketone is
 suggested to be the functional group of TPX capable of alkylating the
 enzyme. We synthesized a novel TPX analogue containing a hydroxamic
 acid instead of the epoxyketone. The hybrid compound cyclic hydroxamic
 acid-containing peptide (CHAP) 1 inhibited HDAC1 at low nanomolar
 concentrations. The HDAC1 inhibition by CHAP1 was reversible as it was
 by TSA, in contrast to the irreversible inhibition by TPX. CHAP with an
 aliphatic chain length of five, which corresponded to that of
 acetylated lysine, was stronger than those with other lengths. These
 results suggest that TPX is a substrate mimic and that the replacement
 of the epoxyketone with the hydroxamic acid converted TPX to an
 inhibitor chelating the zinc like TSA. Interestingly, HDAC6, but not
 HDAC1 or HDAC4, was resistant to TPX and CHAP1, whereas TSA inhibited
 these HDACs to a similar extent. HDAC6 inhibition by TPX at a high
 concentration was reversible, probably because HDAC6 is not alkylated
 by TPX. We further synthesized the counterparts of all known naturally
 occurring cyclic tetrapeptides containing the epoxyketone. HDAC1 was
 highly sensitive to all these CHAPs much more than HDAC6, indicating
 that the structure of the cyclic tetrapeptide framework affects the
 target enzyme specificity. These results suggest that CHAP is a unique
 lead to develop isoform-specific HDAC inhibitors.

Agonist-dependent desensitization and internalization of G
 protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are mediated by the binding of
 arrestins to phosphorylated receptors. The affinity of arrestins for
 the phosphorylated GPCR regulates the ability of the internalized
 receptor to be dephosphorylated and recycled back to the plasma
 membrane. In this study, we show that the naturally occurring loss
 of function vasopressin receptor mutation R137H, which is associated
 with familial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, induces constitutive
 arrestin-mediated desensitization. In contrast to the wild-type
 vasopressin receptor, the nonsignaling R137H receptor is phosphorylated
 and sequestered in arrestin-associated intracellular vesicles even in
 the absence of agonist. Eliminating molecular determinants on the
 receptor that promote high affinity arrestin–receptor interaction
 reestablishes plasma membrane localization and the ability of the
 mutated receptors to signal. These findings suggest that unregulated
 desensitization can contribute to the etiology of a GPCR-based disease,
 implying that pharmacological targeting of GPCR desensitization may be
 therapeutically beneficial.

The 207-kDa polyketide synthase (PKS) module (residues 1–1895) and
 the 143-kDa nonribosomal peptidyl synthetase (NRPS) module (1896–3163)
 of the 350-kDa HMWP1 subunit of yersiniabactin synthetase have been
 expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli in
 soluble forms to characterize the acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain of
 the PKS module and the homologous peptidyl carrier protein
 (PCP3) domain of the NRPS module. The apo-ACP and PCP
 domains could be selectively posttranslationally primed by the
 E. coli ACPS and EntD phosphopantetheinyl transferases
 (PPTases), respectively, whereas the Bacillus subtilis
 PPTase Sfp primed both carrier protein domains in vitro
 or during in vivo coexpression. The holo-NRPS module but
 not the holo-PKS module was then selectively aminoacylated with
 cysteine by the adenylation domain embedded in the HMWP2 subunit of
 yersiniabactin synthetase, acting in trans. When the
 acyltransferase (AT) domain of HMWP1 was analyzed for its ability to
 malonylate the holo carrier protein domains, in cis
 acylation was first detected. Then, in trans
 malonylation of the excised holo-ACP or holo-PCP3–TE
 fragments by HMWP1 showed both were malonylated with a 3:1 catalytic
 efficiency ratio, showing a promiscuity to the AT domain.

Direct structural information obtained for many proteins supports
 the following conclusions. The amino acid sequences of proteins can
 stabilize not only the final native state but also a small set of
 discrete partially folded native-like intermediates. Intermediates are
 formed in steps that use as units the cooperative secondary structural
 elements of the native protein. Earlier intermediates guide the
 addition of subsequent units in a process of sequential
 stabilization mediated by native-like tertiary interactions.
 The resulting stepwise self-assembly process automatically constructs a
 folding pathway, whether linear or branched. These conclusions are
 drawn mainly from hydrogen exchange-based methods, which can depict the
 structure of infinitesimally populated folding intermediates at
 equilibrium and kinetic intermediates with subsecond lifetimes. Other
 kinetic studies show that the polypeptide chain enters the folding
 pathway after an initial free-energy-uphill conformational search. The
 search culminates by finding a native-like topology that can support
 forward (native-like) folding in a free-energy-downhill manner. This
 condition automatically defines an initial transition state, the search
 for which sets the maximum possible (two-state) folding rate. It also
 extends the sequential stabilization strategy, which depends on a
 native-like context, to the first step in the folding process. Thus the
 native structure naturally generates its own folding pathway. The same
 amino acid code that translates into the final equilibrium native
 structure—by virtue of propensities, patterning, secondary structural
 cueing, and tertiary context—also produces its kinetic
 accessibility.

Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have been derived from the
 inner cell mass cells of blastocysts (embryonic stem cells) and
 primordial germ cells of the developing gonadal ridge (embryonic germ
 cells). Like their mouse counterparts, hPSCs can be maintained in
 culture in an undifferentiated state and, upon differentiation,
 generate a wide variety of cell types. Embryoid body (EB) formation is
 a requisite step in the process of in vitro
 differentiation of these stem cells and has been used to derive neurons
 and glia, vascular endothelium, hematopoietic cells, cardiomyocytes,
 and glucose-responsive insulin-producing cells from mouse PSCs. EBs
 generated from human embryonic germ cell cultures have also been found
 to contain a wide variety of cell types, including neural cells,
 vascular endothelium, muscle cells, and endodermal derivatives. Here,
 we report the isolation and culture of cells from human EBs as well as
 a characterization of their gene expression during growth in several
 different culture environments. These heterogeneous cell cultures are
 capable of robust and long-term [>70 population doublings (PD)]
 proliferation in culture, have normal karyotypes, and can be
 cryopreserved, clonally isolated, and stably transfected. Cell cultures
 and clonal lines retain a broad pattern of gene expression including
 simultaneous expression of markers normally associated with cells of
 neural, vascular/hematopoietic, muscle, and endoderm lineages. The
 growth and expression characteristics of these EB-derived cells suggest
 that they are relatively uncommitted precursor or progenitor cells.
 EB-derived cells may be suited to studies of human cell differentiation
 and may play a role in future transplantation therapies.

Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) can associate with
 integrin αvβ3 on the surface of endothelial
 cells, thereby promoting vascular invasion. Here, we describe an
 organic molecule (TSRI265) selected for its ability to bind to integrin
 αvβ3 and block
 αvβ3 interaction with MMP2. Although
 disrupting αvβ3/MMP2 complex formation,
 TSRI265 has no effect on αvβ3 binding to
 its extracellular matrix ligand vitronectin and does not influence MMP2
 activation or catalytic activity directly. However, TSRI265 acts as a
 potent antiangiogenic agent and thereby blocks tumor growth in
 vivo. These findings suggest that activated MMP2 does not
 facilitate vascular invasion during angiogenesis unless it forms a
 complex with αvβ3 on the endothelial cell
 surface. By disrupting endothelial cell invasion without broadly
 suppressing cell adhesion or MMP function, the use of compounds such as
 TSRI265 may provide a novel therapeutic approach for diseases
 associated with uncontrolled angiogenesis.

The role of PKN, a fatty acid- and Rho small GTPase-activated
 protein kinase, in cell-cycle regulation was analyzed. Microinjection
 of the active form of PKN into a Xenopus embryo caused
 cleavage arrest, whereas normal cell division proceeded in the control
 embryo microinjected with buffer or the inactive form of PKN. Exogenous
 addition of the active form of PKN delayed mitotic timing in
 Xenopus egg cycling extracts judging by morphology of
 sperm nuclei and Cdc2/cyclin B histone H1 kinase activity. The
 kinase-negative form of PKN did not affect the timing, suggesting that
 delayed mitotic timing depends on the kinase activity of PKN. The
 dephosphorylation of Tyr-15 of Cdc2 was also delayed in correlation
 with Cdc2/cyclin B histone H1 kinase activation in extracts
 containing active PKN. The Cdc25C activity for the dephosphorylation of
 Tyr-15 in Cdc2 was suppressed by pretreatment with the active form of
 PKN. Furthermore, PKN efficiently phosphorylated Cdc25C in
 vitro, indicating that PKN directly inhibits Cdc25C activity by
 phosphorylation. These results suggest that PKN plays a significant
 role in the control of mitotic timing by inhibition of Cdc25C.

Expression of the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene
 BRCA1 is down-regulated in sporadic breast and ovarian
 cancer cases. Therefore, the identification of genes involved in the
 regulation of BRCA1 expression might lead to new
 insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of these tumors. In the
 present study, an “inverse genomics” approach based on a
 randomized ribozyme gene library was applied to identify cellular genes
 regulating BRCA1 expression. A ribozyme gene library
 with randomized target recognition sequences was introduced into human
 ovarian cancer-derived cells stably expressing a selectable marker
 [enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)] under the control of the
 BRCA1 promoter. Cells in which BRCA1
 expression was upregulated by particular ribozymes were selected
 through their concomitant increase in EGFP expression. The cellular
 target gene of one ribozyme was identified to be the dominant negative
 transcriptional regulator Id4. Modulation of
 Id4 expression resulted in inversely regulated
 expression of BRCA1. In addition, increase in
 Id4 expression was associated with the ability of cells
 to exhibit anchorage-independent growth, demonstrating the biological
 relevance of this gene. Our data suggest that Id4 is a
 crucial gene regulating BRCA1 expression and might
 therefore be important for the BRCA1 regulatory pathway
 involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic breast and ovarian cancer.

The oncoproteins P3k (homolog of the catalytic subunit of class IA
 phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and Akt (protein kinase B) induce oncogenic
 transformation of chicken embryo fibroblasts. The transformed cells
 show constitutive phosphorylation of the positive regulator of
 translation p70S6 kinase (S6K) and of the eukaryotic initiation factor
 4E-BP1 binding protein (4E-BP1), a negative regulator of translation.
 Phosphorylation activates S6K and inactivates 4E-BP1. A mutant of Akt
 that retains kinase activity but does not induce phosphorylation of S6K
 or of 4E-BP1 fails to transform chicken embryo fibroblasts, suggesting
 a correlation between the oncogenicity of Akt and phosphorylation of
 S6K and 4E-BP1. The macrolide antibiotic rapamycin effectively blocks
 oncogenic transformation induced by either P3k or Akt but does not
 reduce the transforming activity of 11 other oncoproteins. Rapamycin
 inhibits the kinase mTOR, an important regulator of translation, and
 this inhibition requires binding of the antibiotic to the immunophilin
 FKBP12. Displacement of rapamycin from FKBP12 relieves the inhibition
 of mTOR and also restores P3k-induced transformation. These data are in
 accord with the hypothesis that transformation by P3k or Akt involves
 intervention in translational controls.

PC-cell-derived growth factor (PCDGF) is an 88-kDa glycoprotein
 corresponding to the granulin precursor. We have reported that PCDGF
 was expressed in human breast cancer cells. In estrogen-receptor
 positive cells, 17-β-estradiol (E2) transcriptionally
 stimulated PCDGF expression in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. We
 demonstrate here that PCDGF mediates the mitogenic effect of
 E2 in MCF-7 cells. PCDGF substituted for E2 to
 stimulate DNA synthesis. The E2 mitogenic effect was
 inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by anti-PCDGF neutralizing
 antibody. Inhibition of PCDGF expression by antisense transfection also
 inhibited the E2 mitogenic effect. In contrast,
 overexpression of PCDGF in MCF-7 cells resulted in cells that were able
 to proliferate in the absence of estrogen and were tamoxifen resistant.
 The PCDGF signaling pathway was examined. Like E2, PCDGF
 stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. PCDGF could
 substitute for E2 in stimulating cyclin D1 expression. The
 cyclin D1 stimulation by E2 was 50% inhibited by
 anti-PCDGF antibody. In contrast, PCDGF did not stimulate
 c-myc expression, another molecular target of
 E2. We conclude that autocrine PCDGF mediates the
 E2 mitogenic effect via stimulation of cyclin D1. These
 studies provide information on estrogen action and identify an
 autocrine molecular target in human breast cancer cells.

Activation of phospholipase C in nonexcitable cells causes the
 release of calcium (Ca2+) from intracellular stores and
 activation of Ca2+ influx by means of Ca2+
 release-activated channels (ICRAC) in the plasma membrane.
 The molecular identity and the mechanism of ICRAC channel
 activation are poorly understood. Using the patch–clamp technique,
 here we describe the plasma membrane Ca2+ channels in human
 carcinoma A431 cells, which can be activated by extracellular UTP, by
 depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores after exposure to
 the Ca2+-pump inhibitor thapsigargin, or by loading the
 cells with Ca2+ chelator
 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetate.
 The observed channels display the same conductance and gating
 properties as previously described Imin channels, but have
 significantly lower conductance for monovalent cations than the
 ICRAC channels. Thus, we concluded that the
 depletion-activated Ca2+ current in A431 cells is supported
 by ICRAC-like (ICRACL) channels, identical to
 Imin. We further demonstrated synergism in activation of
 ICRACL Ca2+ channels by extracellular UTP and
 intracellular inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate (IP3),
 apparently because of reduction in phosphatidylinositol
 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) levels in the patch. Prolonged
 exposure of patches to thapsigargin renders ICRACL
 Ca2+ channels unresponsive to IP3 but still
 available to activation by the combined action of IP3 and
 anti-PIP2 antibody. Based on these data, we concluded that
 phospholipase C-mediated and store-operated Ca2+ influx
 pathways in A431 cells converge on the same ICRACL
 Ca2+ channel, which can be modulated by PIP2.

Mammalian bladder epithelium functions as an effective permeability
 barrier. We demonstrate here that this epithelium can also function as
 a secretory tissue directly involved in modifying urinary protein
 composition. Our data indicate that normal bovine urothelium
 synthesizes, as its major differentiation products, two well-known
 proteases: tissue-type plasminogen activator and urokinase, as well as
 a serine protease inhibitor, PP5. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
 urothelium secretes these proteins in a polarized fashion into the
 urine via a cAMP- and calcium-regulated pathway. Urinary plasminogen
 activators of ruminants are therefore urothelium derived rather then
 kidney derived as in some other species; this heterogeneity may have
 evolved in response to different physiological or dietary factors. In
 conjunction with our recent finding that transgenic mouse urothelium
 can secrete ectopically expressed human growth hormone into the urine,
 our data establish that normal mammalian urothelium can function not
 only as a permeability barrier but also as a secretor of urinary
 proteins that can play physiological or pathological roles in the
 urinary tract.

In the growth plate of endochondral bones, parathyroid hormone
 (PTH)-related peptide (PTHrP) regulates the rate of chondrocyte
 maturation from prehypertrophic chondrocytes to hypertrophic
 chondrocytes. Using an antibody specific for Sox9 phosphorylated at
 serine 181 (S181), one of the two consensus protein kinase
 A phosphorylation sites of Sox9, we showed that the addition of PTHrP
 strongly increased the phosphorylation of SOX9 in COS7 cells
 transfected with both SOX9- and PTH/PTHrP receptor-expressing
 vectors. PTHrP also increased the SOX9-dependent activity of
 chondrocyte-specific enhancers in the gene for type II collagen
 (Col2a1) in transient transfection experiments. This
 increased enhancer activity did not occur with a Sox9 mutant harboring
 serine-to-alanine substitutions in its two consensus protein kinase A
 phosphorylation sites. Consistent with these results, PTHrP also
 increased Col2a1 mRNA levels in rat chondrosarcoma cells
 as well as 10T1/2 mesenchymal cells transfected with a PTH/PTHrP
 receptor expressing plasmid. No phosphorylation of Sox9 at
 S181 was detected in prehypertrophic chondrocytes of the
 growth plate or any chondrocytes of PTH/PTHrP receptor null mutants.
 In contrast in wild-type mouse embryos, previous immunohistochemistry
 experiments indicated that Sox9 phosphorylated at S181 was
 detected almost exclusively in chondrocytes of the prehypertrophic
 zone. Sox9, regardless of the phosphorylation state, was present in all
 chondrocytes of both genotypes except hypertrophic chondrocytes. Our
 results indicated that Sox9 is a target of PTHrP signaling in
 prehypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate. We hypothesize that
 Sox9 mediates at least some effects of PTHrP in the growth plate and
 that the PTHrP-dependent increased transcriptional activity of Sox9
 helps maintain the chondrocyte phenotype of cells in the
 prehypertrophic zone and inhibits their maturation to hypertrophic
 chondrocytes.

Mutual trophic interactions between contiguous habitats have
 remained poorly understood despite their potential significance for
 community maintenance in ecological landscapes. In a deciduous forest
 and stream ecotone, aquatic insect emergence peaked around spring, when
 terrestrial invertebrate biomass was low. In contrast, terrestrial
 invertebrate input to the stream occurred primarily during summer, when
 aquatic invertebrate biomass was nearly at its lowest. Such reciprocal,
 across-habitat prey flux alternately subsidized both forest birds and
 stream fishes, accounting for 25.6% and 44.0% of the annual total
 energy budget of the bird and fish assemblages, respectively. Seasonal
 contrasts between allochthonous prey supply and in situ
 prey biomass determine the importance of reciprocal subsidies.

In mammals, Robertsonian (Rb) translocation (the joining of
 two telo/acrocentric chromosomes at their centromere to form a
 metacentric) is the most effective process in chromosomal evolution
 leading to speciation; its occurrence also affects human health
 (through the induction of trisomies) and the fertility of farm animals.
 To understand the mechanism of Rb translocation, we used the house
 mouse as a model system and studied the organization of pericentromeric
 satellite DNAs (satDNA) of telocentrics and Rb chromosomes, both minor
 and major satDNA. The chromosome-orientation fluorescence in
 situ hybridization (CO-FISH) technique was used to analyze the
 major satDNA. To detect the very small amount of minor satDNA, a
 procedure was developed that combines CO-FISH with primed in
 situ labeling and conventional FISH and is five times more
 sensitive than the CO-FISH procedure alone. It was found that both the
 major and the minor satDNA tandem repeats are oriented head-to-tail in
 telocentric and Rb chromosomes, and their polarity is always the same
 relative to the centromere. We suggest that all tandemly repetitive
 satDNAs in a species probably are locked into such a symmetry
 constraint as a universal consequence of chromosomal evolution. Rb
 translocation breakpoints were found localized within the minor satDNA
 of telocentrics, and these sequences contributed symmetrically to the
 formation of the centromeric region of the Rb chromosomes. These
 results are important for an understanding of the geometry of Rb
 translocations and suggest the study of DNA orientation as a new tool
 for investigating these rearrangements.

Rapidly evolving entities, such as viruses, can undergo complex
 genetic changes in the face of strong selective pressure. We have
 developed a modified heteroduplex tracking assay (HTA) capable of
 detecting the presence of single, specific mutations or sets of linked
 mutations. The initial application of this approach, termed
 multiple-site-specific (MSS) HTA, was directed toward the detection of
 mutations in the HIV-1 pro gene at positions 46, 48, 54,
 82, 84, and 90, which are associated with resistance to multiple
 protease inhibitors. We demonstrate that MSS HTA is sensitive and
 largely specific to all targeted mutations. The assay allows the
 accurate and reproducible quantitation of viral subpopulations
 comprising 3% or more of the total population. Furthermore, we used
 MSS HTA in longitudinal studies of pro gene evolution
 in vitro and in vivo. In the examples
 shown here, populations turned over rapidly and more than one
 population was present frequently. To demonstrate the versatility of
 MSS HTA, we also constructed a probe sensitive to changes at positions
 181 and 184 of the RT coding domain. Changes at these positions are
 involved in resistance to nevirapine and 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine
 (3TC), respectively. This assay easily detected the evolution of
 resistance to 3TC. MSS HTA provides a rapid and sensitive approach for
 detecting the presence of and quantifying complex mixtures of distinct
 genotypes, including genetically linked mutations, and, as one example,
 represents a useful tool for following the evolution of drug resistance
 during failure of HIV-1 antiviral therapy.

The identification of clones within bacterial populations is often
 taken as evidence for a low rate of recombination, but the validity of
 this inference is rarely examined. We have used statistical tests of
 congruence between gene trees to examine the extent and significance of
 recombination in six bacterial pathogens. For Neisseria
 meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae,
 Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus
 aureus, the congruence between the maximum likelihood trees
 reconstructed using seven house-keeping genes was in most cases no
 better than that between each tree and trees of random topology. The
 lack of congruence between gene trees in these four species, which
 include both naturally transformable and nontransformable species, is
 in three cases supported by high ratios of recombination to point
 mutation during clonal diversification (estimates of this parameter
 were not possible for Strep. pyogenes). In contrast,
 gene trees constructed for Hemophilus influenzae and
 pathogenic isolates of Escherichia coli showed a higher
 degree of congruence, suggesting lower rates of recombination. The
 impact of recombination therefore varies between bacterial species but
 in many species is sufficient to obliterate the phylogenetic signal in
 gene trees.

DNA sequence evidence supports a superordinal clade of mammals that
 comprises elephants, sea cows, hyraxes, aardvarks, elephant shrews,
 golden moles, and tenrecs, which all have their origins in Africa, and
 therefore are dubbed Afrotheria. Morphologically, this appears an
 unlikely assemblage, which challenges—by including golden moles and
 tenrecs—the monophyly of the order Lipotyphla (Insectivora). We here
 identify in three proteins unique combinations of apomorphous amino
 acid replacements that support this clade. The statistical support for
 such “sequence signatures” as unambiguous synapomorphic evidence
 for the naturalness of the Afrotherian clade is reported. Using
 likelihood, combinatorial, and Bayesian methods we show that the
 posterior probability of the mammalian tree containing the Afrotherian
 clade is effectively 1.0, based on conservative assumptions. Presenting
 sequence data for another African insectivore, the otter shrew
 Micropotamogale lamottei, we demonstrate that such
 signatures are diagnostic for including newly investigated species in
 the Afrotheria. Sequence signatures provide
 “protein-morphological” synapomorphies that may aid in
 visualizing monophyletic groupings.

Analysis of genetic variation among modern individuals is

 recognizable traces in the current gene pool.

D-type cyclins (cyclins D1, D2, and D3) are key components of cell
 cycle machinery in mammalian cells. These proteins are believed to
 drive cell cycle progression by associating with their kinase partners,
 cyclin-dependent kinases, and by directing phosphorylation of critical
 cellular substrates. In addition, D-cyclins play a kinase-independent
 role by sequestering cell cycle inhibitors p27Kip1 and
 p21Cip1. In the past, we and others generated cyclin
 D1-deficient mice and have shown that these mice display developmental
 abnormalities, hypoplastic retinas, and pregnancy-insensitive mammary
 glands. To test the significance of cyclin D1–p27Kip1
 interaction within a living mouse, we crossed cyclin D1-deficient mice
 with mice lacking p27Kip1, and we generated double-mutant
 cyclin D1−/−p27−/− animals. Here we report
 that ablation of p27Kip1 restores
 essentially normal development in cyclin D1-deficient mice. Our results
 provide genetic evidence that p27Kip1 functions downstream
 of cyclin D1.

Histone acetylation and deacetylation play essential roles in
 eukaryotic gene regulation. Reversible modifications of core histones
 are catalyzed by two intrinsic enzymes, histone acetyltransferase and
 histone deacetylase (HD). In general, histone deacetylation is related
 to transcriptional gene silencing, whereas acetylation correlates with
 gene activation. We produced transgenic plants expressing the antisense
 Arabidopsis HD (AtHD1) gene. AtHD1 is a homolog of human
 HD1 and RPD3 global transcriptional regulator in yeast. Expression of
 the antisense AtHD1 caused dramatic reduction in
 endogenous AtHD1 transcription, resulting in
 accumulation of acetylated histones, notably tetraacetylated H4.
 Reduction in AtHD1 expression and AtHD1 production and
 changes in acetylation profiles were associated with various
 developmental abnormalities, including early senescence, ectopic
 expression of silenced genes, suppression of apical dominance, homeotic
 changes, heterochronic shift toward juvenility, flower defects, and
 male and female sterility. Some of the phenotypes could be attributed
 to ectopic expression of tissue-specific genes (e.g.,
 SUPERMAN) in vegetative tissues. No changes in genomic
 DNA methylation were detected in the transgenic plants. These results
 suggest that AtHD1 is a global regulator, which controls gene
 expression during development through DNA-sequence independent or
 epigenetic mechanisms in plants. In addition to DNA methylation,
 histone modifications may be involved in a general regulatory mechanism
 responsible for plant plasticity and variation in nature.

We have developed a strategy for multiplex PCR based on PCR
 suppression. PCR suppression allows DNA target amplification with only
 one sequence-specific primer per target and a second primer that is
 common for all targets. Therefore, an n-plex PCR would require only n +
 1 primers. We have demonstrated uniform, efficient amplification of
 targeted sequences in 14-plex PCR. The high specificity of suppression
 PCR also provides multiplexed amplification with allele specificity.
 Multiplexed PCR was used to develop assays for genotyping DNA samples
 from cystic fibrosis-affected individuals. The new approach greatly
 simplifies primer design, significantly increases the PCR multiplexing
 level, and decreases the overall primer cost. In addition, this assay
 is more readily amenable to automation and is therefore suitable for
 high-throughput genetic diagnostics.

Many circular genomes have replication termination systems, yet
 disruption of these systems does not cause an obvious defect in growth
 or viability. We have found that the replication termination system of
 Bacillus subtilis contributes to accurate chromosome
 partitioning. Partitioning of the terminus region requires that
 chromosome dimers, that have formed as a result of RecA-mediated
 homologous recombination, be resolved to monomers by the site-specific
 recombinase encoded by ripX. In addition, the chromosome
 must be cleared from the region of formation of the division septum.
 This process is facilitated by the spoIIIE gene product
 which is required for movement of a chromosome out of the way of the
 division septum during sporulation. We found that deletion of
 rtp, which encodes the replication termination protein,
 in combination with mutations in ripX or
 spoIIIE, led to an increase in production of anucleate
 cells. This increase in production of anucleate cells depended on
 recA, indicating that there is probably an increase in
 chromosome dimer formation in the absence of the replication
 termination system. Our results also indicate that SpoIIIE probably
 enhances the function of the RipX recombinase system. We also
 determined the subcellular location of the replication termination
 protein and found that it is a good marker for the position of the
 chromosome terminus.

We have constructed DNA microarrays containing 17,871 genes,
 representing about 94% of the 18,967 genes currently annotated in the
 Caenorhabditis elegans genome. These DNA
 microarrays can be used as a tool to define a nearly complete molecular
 profile of gene expression levels associated with different
 developmental stages, growth conditions, or worm strains. Here, we used
 these full-genome DNA microarrays to show the relative levels of gene
 expression for nearly every gene during development, from eggs through
 adulthood. These expression data can help reveal when a gene may act
 during development. We also compared gene expression in males to that
 of hermaphrodites and found a total of 2,171 sex-regulated genes
 (P < 0.05). The sex-regulated genes provide a
 global view of the differences between the sexes at a molecular level
 and identify many genes likely to be involved in sex-specific
 differentiation and behavior.

Retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) is involved in multiple signaling
 pathways, as a heterodimeric partner of several nuclear receptors. To
 investigate its function in energy homeostasis, we have selectively
 ablated the RXRα gene in adipocytes of 4-week-old transgenic mice by
 using the tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ERT2 recombination
 system. Mice lacking RXRα in adipocytes were resistant to dietary and
 chemically induced obesity and impaired in fasting-induced lipolysis.
 Our results also indicate that RXRα is involved in adipocyte
 differentiation. Thus, our data demonstrate the feasibility of
 adipocyte-selective temporally controlled gene engineering and reveal a
 central role of RXRα in adipogenesis, probably as a
 heterodimeric partner for peroxisome proliferator-activated
 receptor γ.

The cleavage model for signal transduction by receptors of the
 LIN-12/Notch family posits that ligand binding leads to cleavage
 within the transmembrane domain, so that the intracellular domain is
 released to translocate to the nucleus and activate target gene
 expression. The familial Alzheimer's disease-associated protein
 Presenilin is required for LIN-12/Notch signaling, and several lines
 of evidence suggest that Presenilin mediates the transmembrane cleavage
 event that releases the LIN-12/Notch intracellular domain. However,
 doubt was cast on this possibility by a report that Presenilin is not
 required for the transducing activity of NECN, a
 constitutively active transmembrane form of Notch, in
 Drosophila. Here, we have reassessed this finding and
 show instead that Presenilin is required for activity of
 NECN for all cell fate decisions examined. Our results
 indicate that transmembrane cleavage and signal transduction are
 strictly correlated, supporting the cleavage model for signal
 transduction by LIN-12/Notch and a role for Presenilin in mediating
 the ligand-induced transmembrane cleavage.

Genetic analysis of autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
 (IDDM) has focused on genes controlling immune functions, with little
 investigation of innate susceptibility determinants expressed at the
 level of target β cells. The Alloxan (AL) Resistant (R) Leiter (Lt)
 mouse strain, closely related to the IDDM-prone nonobese diabetic
 (NOD)/Lt strain, demonstrates the importance of such determinants.
 ALR mice are unusual in their high constitutive expression of molecules
 associated with dissipation of free-radical stress systemically and at
 the β-cell level. ALR islets were found to be remarkably
 resistant to two different combinations of β-cytotoxic cytokines
 (IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor α, and IFN-γ) that destroyed islets
 from the related NOD and alloxan-susceptible strains. The close MHC
 relatedness between the NOD and ALR strains (H2-Kd and
 H2-Ag7 identical) allowed us to examine whether ALR islet
 cells could survive autoimmune destruction by NOD-derived
 Kd-restricted diabetogenic cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones
 (AI4 and the insulin-reactive G9C8 clones). Both clones killed islet
 cells from all Kd-expressing strains except ALR. ALR
 resistance to diabetogenic immune systems was determined in
 vivo by means of adoptive transfer of the G9C8 clone or by
 chimerizing lethally irradiated ALR or reciprocal (ALR ×
 NOD)F1 recipients with NOD bone marrow. In all in
 vivo systems, ALR and F1 female recipients of NOD
 marrow remained IDDM free; in contrast, all of the NOD recipients
 became diabetic. In conclusion, the ALR mouse presents a unique
 opportunity to identify dominant IDDM resistance determinants expressed
 at the β cell level.

The mechanisms controlling induction of anergy at the level of
 naïve CD4+ T cells are poorly understood but
 thought to reflect limited contact with costimulatory molecules during
 T cell antigen receptor (TCR) ligation. To clarify this question,
 naïve TCR transgenic CD4+ cells were exposed to
 specific peptide presented by transfected antigen-presenting cells
 (APC) expressing MHC class II molecules with defined accessory
 molecules. Significantly, culturing CD4+ cells with APC
 expressing MHC II plus peptide alone elicited early TCR signaling but
 failed to induce either proliferation or anergy. Culture with APC
 expressing MHC II plus B7 molecules led to strong proliferation and T
 cell priming but no anergy. In marked contrast, conspicuous induction
 of anergy occurred after T cell culture with APC expressing MHC class
 II and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Thus, at the level
 of naïve CD4+ cells, anergy induction appears to
 reflect selective contact with APC expressing ICAM-1 in the absence of
 B7.

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a ligand of the receptor tyrosine
 kinase encoded by the c-Met protooncogene.
 HGF/Met signaling has multifunctional effects on various cell
 types. We sought to determine the role of HGF/Met in
 apoptosis and identify signal transducers involved in this
 process. In experiments with human SK-LMS-1 leiomyosarcoma cells, we
 show that the Akt kinase is activated by HGF in a time- and
 dose-dependent manner by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase).
 Akt is also activated by active tumorigenic forms of Met, i.e.,
 ligand-independent Tpr-Met, a truncated and constitutively dimerized
 form of Met, and a mutationally activated version of Met corresponding
 to that found in human hereditary papillary renal carcinoma. In NIH 3T3
 cells transfected with wild-type Met, HGF inhibits apoptosis
 induced by serum starvation and UV irradiation. HGF-induced survival
 correlates with Akt activity and is inhibited by the specific
 PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, indicating that HGF inhibits cell death
 through the PI3-kinase/Akt signal transduction pathway.
 Furthermore, transiently transfected Tpr-Met activates Akt (both Akt1
 and Akt2) and protects cells from apoptosis. Mitogen-activated
 protein kinase (MAPK) also is activated by HGF and rescues cells from
 apoptosis, although the cytoprotective effect is less marked
 than for PI3-kinase/Akt. Blocking MAPK with the specific MAPK
 kinase inhibitor PD098059 impairs the ability of HGF to promote cell
 survival. Similar results were obtained with NIH 3T3 cells expressing
 the fusion protein Trk-Met and stimulated with nerve growth factor, the
 Trk ligand. These results demonstrate that HGF/Met is capable of
 protecting cells from apoptosis by using both
 PI3-kinase/Akt and, to a lesser extent, MAPK pathways.

CD8+ T cell-mediated antiviral activity against
 HIV has been described consistently in infected individuals; however,
 the role of this activity in controlling replication of HIV in the
 latently infected, resting CD4+ T cell reservoir is
 unclear. By using an ex vivo system, we show that
 replication of HIV in this viral reservoir is effectively suppressed in
 coculture by autologous CD8+ T cells in long-term
 nonprogressors (LTNPs) and in patients whose viremia was controlled by
 highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), but not in therapy-naive
 patients who had substantial levels of plasma viremia. This antiviral
 activity was largely independent of cytotoxic CD8+ T
 lymphocytes (CTL). When the role of soluble CD8+ T
 cell-derived factors was examined, we found that CC-chemokines played a
 major role in inhibition of viral replication in the latent viral
 reservoir in some LTNPs and patients receiving HAART, but not in
 chronically infected patients who were not receiving antiretroviral
 therapy. Potent antiviral activity, independent of CC-chemokines, was
 found mainly in patients in whom HAART was initiated shortly after the
 acute phase of HIV infection. These results indicate that
 CD8+ T cells provide potent suppressive activity against
 HIV replication in the latent viral reservoir via direct cellular
 contact in patients who are naturally LTNPs or in those who are treated
 with HAART. Furthermore, the profound antiviral activity exerted by
 non-CC-chemokine soluble factors in infected patients who began HAART
 early in HIV infection suggests that preservation of this
 HIV-suppressive mechanism by early initiation of therapy may play an
 important role in the containment of viral replication in infected
 patients following interruption of therapy.

Approximately one-third of patients with porphyria cutanea tarda
 (PCT), the most common porphyria in humans, inherit a single mutant
 allele of the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (URO-D)
 gene. PCT associated with URO-D mutations is designated
 familial PCT. The phenotype is characterized by a photosensitive
 dermatosis with hepatic accumulation and urinary excretion of
 uroporphyrin and hepta-carboxylic porphyrins. Most heterozygotes for
 URO-D mutations do not express a porphyric phenotype
 unless hepatic siderosis is present. Hemochromatosis gene
 (HFE) mutations are frequently found when the phenotype
 is expressed. We used homologous recombination to disrupt one allele of
 murine URO-D. URO-D+/− mice
 had half-wild type (wt) URO-D protein and enzymatic activity in all
 tissues but did not accumulate hepatic porphyrins, indicating that
 half-normal URO-D activity is not rate limiting. When
 URO-D+/− mice were injected with
 iron-dextran and given drinking water containing δ-aminolevulinic
 acid for 21 days, hepatic porphyrins accumulated, and hepatic URO-D
 activity was reduced to 20% of wt. We bred mice homozygous for an
 HFE gene disruption
 (HFE−/−) to
 URO-D+/− mice, generating mice with the
 URO-D+/−/HFE−/−
 genotype. These animals developed a porphyric phenotype by 14 weeks of
 age without ALA supplementation, and URO-D activity was reduced to 14%
 of wt. These data indicate that iron overload alone is sufficient to
 reduce URO-D activity to rate-limiting levels in
 URO-D+/− mice. The
 URO-D+/− mouse serves as an excellent model
 of familial PCT and affords the opportunity to define the mechanism by
 which iron influences URO-D activity.

Adenomas are the precursors of most colorectal cancers.
 Hyperplastic polyps have been linked to the subset of colorectal
 cancers showing DNA microsatellite instability, but little is known of
 their underlying genetic etiology. Using a strategy that isolates
 differentially methylated sequences from hyperplastic polyps and normal
 mucosa, we identified a 370-bp sequence containing the 5′ untranslated
 region and the first exon of a gene that we have called
 HPP1. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was used to
 isolate HPP1 from normal mucosa. Using reverse
 transcription–PCR, HPP1 was expressed in 28 of 30
 (93%) normal colonic samples but in only seven of 30 (23%) colorectal
 cancers (P < 0.001). The 5′ region of
 HPP1 included a CpG island containing 49 CpG sites, of
 which 96% were found to be methylated by bisulfite sequencing of DNA
 from colonic tumor samples. By COBRA analysis, methylation was detected
 in six of nine (66%) adenomas, 17 of 27 (63%) hyperplastic polyps,
 and 46 of 55 (84%) colorectal cancers. There was an inverse
 relationship between methylation level and mRNA expression in cancers
 (r = −0.67; P < 0.001), and
 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine treatment restored HPP1 expression
 in two colorectal cancer cell lines. In situ
 hybridization of HPP1 indicated that expression occurs
 in epithelial and stromal elements in normal mucosa but is silenced in
 both cell types in early colonic neoplasia. HPP1 is
 predicted to encode a transmembrane protein containing follistatin and
 epidermal growth factor-like domains. Silencing of HPP1
 by methylation may increase the probability of neoplastic
 transformation.

Intraerythrocytic malaria parasites replicate by the process of
 schizogeny, during which time they copy their genetic material and
 package it into infective merozoites. These merozoites must then exit
 the host cell to invade new erythrocytes. To better characterize the
 events of merozoite escape, erythrocytes containing Plasmodium
 falciparum schizonts were cultured in the presence of the
 cysteine protease inhibitor,
 l-transepoxy-succinyl-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane
 (E64). This treatment resulted in the accumulation of extraerythrocytic
 merozoites locked within a thin, transparent membrane. Immunomicroscopy
 demonstrated that the single membrane surrounding the merozoites is not
 erythrocytic but rather is derived from the parasitophorous vacuolar
 membrane (PVM). Importantly, structures identical in appearance can be
 detected in untreated cultures at low frequency. Further studies
 revealed that (i) merozoites from the PVM-enclosed
 merozoite structures (PEMS) are invasive, viable, and capable of normal
 development; (ii) PEMS can be purified easily and
 efficiently; and (iii) when PEMS are added to uninfected
 red blood cells, released merozoites can establish a synchronous wave
 of infection. These observations suggest that
 l-transepoxy-succinyl-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (E64)
 causes an accumulation of an intermediate normally present during the
 process of rupture. We propose a model for the process of rupture:
 merozoites enclosed within the PVM first exit from the host erythrocyte
 and then rapidly escape from the PVM by a proteolysis-dependent
 mechanism.

IL-10 is a pleiotropic cytokine that acts as an important regulator
 of macrophage, T cell, and natural killer cell functions. Human IL-10
 (hIL-10) has both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on a wide variety
 of cell types. Viral IL-10 (vIL-10) possesses only a subset of
 hIL-10's activities, predominantly its suppression of cytokine
 synthesis by T helper type 1 clones. In the present report, we
 evaluated tissue accumulation and biological activity of hIL-10 and
 vIL-10 in vivo in individual organs by using a
 first-generation adenoviral (Ad) vector administered intratracheally
 and intravenously. We report the observation that Ad vectors delivering
 vIL-10, but not hIL-10, are associated with prolonged expression in the
 lung (>42 days) when delivered intratracheally. In contrast, there was
 no prolongation in vIL-10 expression when Ad vectors were intravenously
 administered, although vIL-10 levels in the tissue, but not serum, were
 markedly increased relative to hIL-10. Moreover, we report an augmented
 capacity of expressed vIL-10 versus hIL-10 to suppress the acute
 inflammatory responses in the lung to intratracheal administration of
 Ad. These findings confirm fundamental differences in Ad-induced
 expression of vIL-10 and hIL-10 when administered to the lungs. The
 results further suggest that Ad vectors expressing vIL-10 may have a
 role as anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment of acute and chronic
 lung inflammation.

In Gram-negative bacteria, TEM-1 β-lactamase provides the major
 mechanism of plasmid-mediated β-lactam resistance. Natural variants
 of TEM-1 with increased antibiotic resistance have appeared in response
 to the use of extended-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics (e.g.,
 ceftazidime) and β-lactamase inhibitors (e.g., clavulanic acid). Some
 of the variant enzymes are more efficient at catalyzing β-lactam
 hydrolysis, whereas others are more resistant to inhibitors. M182T is a
 substitution observed in both types of variant TEM-1 β-lactamases.
 This mutation is found only in combination with other amino acid
 substitutions, suggesting that it may correct defects introduced by
 other mutations that alter the specificity. An engineered core
 mutation, L76N, which diminishes the periplasmic β-lactamase activity
 by 100-fold, was used as a model to understand the mechanism of
 suppression of the M182T mutation. Biochemical studies of the L76N
 enzyme alone and in combination with the M182T mutation indicate that
 the M182T substitution acts at the level of folding but does not affect
 the thermodynamic stability of TEM-1 β-lactamase. Thus, the M182T
 substitution is an example of a naturally occurring mutation that has
 evolved to alter the folding pathway of a protein and confer a
 selective advantage during the evolution of drug resistance.

The hrp gene clusters of plant pathogenic bacteria
 control pathogenicity on their host plants and ability to elicit the
 hypersensitive reaction in resistant plants. Some hrp
 gene products constitute elements of the type III secretion system, by
 which effector proteins are exported and delivered into plant cells.
 Here, we show that the hrpZ gene product from the bean
 halo-blight pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv.
 phaseolicola (HrpZPsph), is secreted in an
 hrp-dependent manner in P. syringae pv.
 phaseolicola and exported by the type III secretion
 system in the mammalian pathogen Yersinia
 enterocolitica. HrpZPsph was found to associate
 stably with liposomes and synthetic bilayer membranes. Under symmetric
 ionic conditions, addition of 2 nM of purified recombinant
 HrpZPsph to the cis compartment of planar lipid bilayers
 provoked an ion current with a large unitary conductivity of 207 pS.
 HrpZPsph-related proteins from P. syringae
 pv. tomato or syringae triggered ion
 currents similar to those stimulated by HrpZPsph. The
 HrpZPsph-mediated ion-conducting pore was permeable for
 cations but did not mediate fluxes of Cl−. Such
 pore-forming activity may allow nutrient release and/or delivery of
 virulence factors during bacterial colonization of host plants.

The prefrontal cortex plays a fundamental role in the working
 memory functions of the cerebral cortex and is also the site of
 dysfunction in several neurological and psychiatric disorders,
 including schizophrenia. Prefrontal neurons are distinguished by their
 capacity for sustained activity during the time a stimulus is held in
 memory, and this mnemonic response is considered a substrate for a
 variety of cognitive functions. The neuronal basis for sustained
 activity in prefrontal neurons is unknown but is thought to involve
 recurrent excitation among pyramidal neurons. Recent studies in awake
 behaving monkeys have demonstrated that the persistent activity in
 prefrontal neurons is modulated by dopamine. To examine the mechanisms
 by which dopamine might modulate transmission in local excitatory
 circuits, we have performed dual whole-cell recordings in connected
 pyramidal cell pairs with and without dopamine application. We find
 that dopamine reduces the efficacy of unitary excitatory
 neurotransmission in layer V pyramidal cells by decreasing its
 reliability. These effects, which are reproduced by a selective D1
 agonist and blocked by a D1 antagonist, are independent of voltage
 changes and are not attenuated by blockade of sodium and potassium
 channels in the postsynaptic neurons. We conclude that attenuation of
 local horizontal excitatory synaptic transmission in layer V pyramidal
 neurons by dopamine is through D1 actions at a presynaptic site.

Dopamine acts mainly through the D1/D5 receptor in the prefrontal
 cortex (PFC) to modulate neural activity and behaviors associated with
 working memory. To understand the mechanism of this effect, we examined
 the modulation of excitatory synaptic inputs onto layer V PFC pyramidal
 neurons by D1/D5 receptor stimulation. D1/D5 agonists increased the
 size of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)
 component of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) through a
 postsynaptic mechanism. In contrast, D1/D5 agonists caused a slight
 reduction in the size of the non-NMDA component of EPSCs through a
 small decrease in release probability. With 20 Hz synaptic trains, we
 found that the D1/D5 agonists increased depolarization of summating
 the NMDA component of excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). By
 increasing the NMDA component of EPSCs, yet slightly reducing release,
 D1/D5 receptor activation selectively enhanced sustained synaptic
 inputs and equalized the sizes of EPSPs in a 20-Hz train.

Mice engineered to lack GM2/GD2 synthase (GalNAc-T), with
 resultant deficit of GM2, GD2, and all gangliotetraose gangliosides,
 were originally described as showing a relatively normal phenotype with
 only a slight reduction in nerve conduction. However, a subsequent
 study showed that similar animals suffer axonal degeneration,
 myelination defects, and impaired motor coordination. We have examined
 the behavior of cerebellar granule neurons from these neonatal
 knockouts in culture and have found evidence of impaired capacity for
 Ca2+ regulation. These cells showed relatively normal
 behavior when grown in the presence of physiological or moderately
 elevated K+ but gradually degenerated in the presence of
 high K+. This degeneration in depolarizing medium was
 accompanied by progressive elevation of intracellular calcium and onset
 of apoptosis, phenomena not observed with normal cells. No
 differences were detected in cells from normal vs. heterozygous mice.
 These findings suggest that neurons from GalNAc-T knockout mice are
 lacking a calcium regulatory mechanism that is modulated by one or more
 of the deleted gangliosides, and they support the hypothesis that
 maintenance of calcium homeostasis is one function of complex
 gangliosides during, and perhaps subsequent to, neuronal development.

We used event-related functional MRI to examine the neural
 consequences of detecting the presence or absence of a stimulus.
 Subjects detected a brief interval of coherent motion embedded in
 dynamic noise that was presented throughout a test period. Several
 brain regions, including V1/V2, middle temporal complex (MT+), left
 intraparietal cortex, and the frontal eye field, were activated at the
 onset of the dynamic noise, irrespective of whether a coherent motion
 target was presented early or late in the test period, or not at all.
 These regions, many of which were motion sensitive, were likely
 involved in searching for and detecting the target. The blood
 oxygenation level-dependent signal in these regions was higher in
 trials in which a target was detected than in trials in which it was
 missed or not presented, indicating that these regions were modulated
 by detection. Moreover, the blood oxygenation leveldependent signal in
 these regions decayed quickly once a target was detected, even though
 the dynamic noise continued to be displayed, indicating that they were
 shut down after detection. Therefore, detection-related modulations
 occurred in the same regions that accumulate target information over
 time, in agreement with current psychological and neural models of
 detection. Many other regions, however, including areas in prefrontal
 cortex and anterior cingulate, were not involved in searching for a
 target. In these regions, activation began early in the test period
 when an early target was detected but began late in the test period
 when a late target was detected or when a response was correctly
 withheld in the absence of a motion target. The signal in these regions
 was therefore triggered by a discrete event during the test interval
 that was related to presence–absence detection.

In the mammalian main olfactory bulb (MOB), the release of
 glutamate from lateral dendrites of mitral cells onto the dendrites of
 granule cells evokes recurrent and lateral inhibition of mitral cell
 activity. Whole-cell voltage recordings in the mouse MOB in
 vivo and in vitro show that recurrent and
 lateral inhibition together control the number, duration, and onset of
 odor-evoked action potential (AP) firing in mitral cells. APs in mitral
 cells propagate into the lateral dendrites and evoke a transient
 increase in dendritic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]),
 which is decremental with distance from the soma, and increases with AP
 number. These results suggest that the extent of AP propagation in
 lateral dendrites of mitral cells, along with the concomitant dendritic
 Ca2+ transient, controls the amplitude of lateral and
 recurrent inhibition and thus is a critical determinant of
 odor-specific AP patterns in the MOB.

Previous studies have established that humans and monkeys with
 damage to striate cortex are able to detect and localize bright targets
 within the resultant scotoma. Electrophysiological evidence in monkeys
 suggests that residual vision also might include sensitivity to
 direction of visual motion. We tested whether macaque monkeys with
 longstanding lesions of striate cortex (V1), sustained in infancy,
 could discriminate visual stimuli on the basis of direction of motion.
 Three monkeys with unilateral striate cortex lesions sustained in
 infancy were tested 2–5 years postlesion on a direction of motion
 discrimination task. Each monkey was trained to make saccadic eye
 movements to a field of moving dots or to withhold such eye movements,
 depending on the direction of motion in a coherent random dot display.
 With smaller motion displays, monkeys were unable to detect or
 discriminate motion within the scotoma, although they could
 discriminate moving from static stimuli. Yet, each monkey was able to
 discriminate direction of motion when the motion stimulus was larger,
 but still confined to the scotoma. The results demonstrate that the
 recovery after infant damage to striate cortex includes some
 sensitivity to direction of visual motion.

We have studied the effects of cAMP on synaptic transmission at the
 calyx of Held and found that forskolin (an activator of adenylate
 cyclase) and 8-Br-cAMP (a membrane-permeable analog of cAMP)
 potentiated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). Direct sampling
 of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) and nonstationary fluctuation analysis
 showed that mEPSCs were not modulated by cAMP, suggesting that the
 locus of modulation is presynaptic. Deconvolution was used to examine
 effects of cAMP on quantal-release rates. By using this method, it was
 shown recently that release probabilities of readily releasable
 vesicles are heterogeneous. Here, we show that cAMP selectively
 increases the number of vesicles with higher release probabilities,
 whereas a slow component of the EPSC, representing vesicles that fuse
 more slowly, is unchanged. cAMP increases the apparent Ca2+
 sensitivity for secretion, but this increase does not reflect an
 increase in release probability necessarily but rather an increase in
 the number of highly sensitive vesicles.

In the olfactory bulb, synaptic transmission between dendrites
 plays an important role in the processing of olfactory information.
 Glutamate released from the dendrites of principal mitral cells excites
 the dendritic spines of granule cells, which in turn release
 γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) back onto mitral cell dendrites. Slow
 N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors on
 granule dendrites are particularly effective in driving this reciprocal
 dendrodendritic inhibition (DDI), raising the possibility that calcium
 influx through NMDA receptors may trigger GABA exocytosis directly. In
 this study, I show that NMDA receptor activation is not an absolute
 requirement and that DDI can be evoked solely by
 α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors
 when granule cell excitability is increased or under conditions that
 slow AMPA receptor kinetics. In physiological extracellular
 Mg2+, DDI elicited by photolysis of caged calcium in mitral
 dendrites is blocked by cadmium and toxins to N- and P/Q-type
 voltage-gated calcium channels. DDI is largely unaffected after granule
 dendrites have been loaded with the slow calcium chelator EGTA,
 suggesting a tight coupling between the site of calcium influx and the
 release machinery governing GABA exocytosis. These results indicate
 that voltage-gated calcium channels play an essential role in dendritic
 GABA release during reciprocal feedback inhibition in the olfactory
 bulb.

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have recently joined the list
 of cell surface receptors that dimerize. Dimerization has been shown to
 alter the ligand-binding, signaling, and trafficking properties of
 these receptors. Recent studies have shown that GPCRs heterodimerize
 with closely related members, resulting in the modulation of their
 function. In this study, we have attempted to determine whether members
 of GPCR superfamilies that couple to different families of G-proteins
 can associate and form oligomers. We chose the β2
 adrenergic receptor that couples to stimulatory G-proteins and δ &
 κ opioid receptors that couple to inhibitory G-proteins.
 β2 and δ receptors undergo robust agonist-mediated
 endocytosis, whereas κ receptors do not. We find that when
 coexpressed, β2 receptors can form heteromeric complexes
 with both δ and κ receptors. This heterooligomerization does
 not significantly alter the ligand binding or coupling properties of
 the receptors. However, it affects the trafficking properties of
 the receptors. For example, we find that δ receptors, when
 coexpressed with β2 receptors, undergo
 isoproterenol-mediated endocytosis. Conversely, β2
 receptors in these cells undergo etorphine-mediated endocytosis.
 However, β2 receptors, when coexpressed with κ
 receptors, undergo neither opioid- nor isoproterenol-mediated
 endocytosis. Moreover, these cells exhibit a substantial decrease in
 the isoproterenol-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein
 kinases. Taken together, these results provide direct evidence of
 heteromerization of GPCRs that couple to different types of G-proteins,
 which results in the modulation of receptor trafficking and signal
 transduction.

Only three of the four thyroid hormone receptor (TR)
 isoforms, α1, β1, and β2, bind thyroid hormone (TH) and are
 considered to be true TRs. TRα2 binds to TH response elements on DNA,
 but its role in vivo is still unknown. We produced mice
 completely deficient in TRα (TRαo/o) that maintain
 normal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration despite
 low serum thyroxine (T4), suggesting increased sensitivity
 to TH. We therefore examined the effects of TH
 (L-3,3′,5-triiodothyronine, L-T3) given to TH-deprived and
 to intact TRαo/o mice. Controls were wild-type (WT) mice
 of the same strain and mice resistant to TH due to deficiency in TRβ
 (TRβ−/−). In liver, T3 produced
 significantly greater responses in TRαo/o and smaller
 responses in TRβ−/− as compared with WT mice. In
 contrast, cardiac responses to L-T3 were absent or reduced
 in TRαo/o, whereas they were similar in WT and
 TRβ−/− mice, supporting the notion that TRα1 is the
 dominant TH-dependent TR isoform in heart. 5-Triiodothyronine
 (L-T3) given to intact mice produced a greater suppression
 of serum T4 in TRαo/o than it did in WT mice
 and reduced by a greater amount the TSH response to TSH-releasing
 hormone. This is an in vivo demonstration that a TR
 deficiency can enhance sensitivity to TH. This effect is likely due to
 the abrogation of the constitutive “silencing” effect of TRα2
 in tissues expressing the TRβ isoforms.

Endothelial nitric oxide (nitrogen monoxide) is synthesized at the
 intravascular/extravascular interface. We previously have reported
 the intravascular half-life of NO, as a result of consumption by
 erythrocytes, as approximately 2 ms. We report here studies designed to
 estimate the lifetime of NO in the parenchymal (extravascular) tissue
 and describe the implications of these results for the distribution of
 NO and oxygen concentration gradients away from the blood vessel. The
 rate of consumption of NO by parenchymal cells (hepatocytes) linearly
 depends on both NO and O2 concentration. We estimate that
 the extravascular half-life of NO will range from 0.09 to >
 2 s, depending on O2 concentration and thus distance
 from the vessel. Computer modeling reveals that this phenomenon,
 coupled with reversible NO inhibition of cellular mitochondrial oxygen
 consumption, substantially extends the zone of adequate tissue cellular
 oxygenation away from the blood vessel, with an especially dramatic
 effect during conditions of increased tissue work (oxygen consumption).
 This represents a second action of NO, in addition to vasodilation, in
 enhancing tissue cellular respiration and provides a possible
 physiological function for the known reversible inhibition of
 mitochondrial respiration by low concentrations of NO.

It has been proposed recently that two types of GnRH receptors
 (GnRHR) exist in a particular species. Here we present data
 demonstrating that at least three types of GnRHR are expressed in a
 single diploid species, the bullfrog. Three different cDNAs, encoding
 distinct types of bullfrog GnRHR (bfGnRHR-1, bfGnRHR-2, and bfGnRHR-3),
 were isolated from pituitary and hindbrain of the bullfrog. BfGnRHR-1
 mRNA was expressed predominantly in pituitary, whereas bfGnRHR-2 and -3
 mRNAs were expressed in brain. The bfGnRHR-1, bfGnRHR-2, and bfGnRHR-3
 proteins have an amino acid identity of ≈30% to ≈35% with
 mammalian GnRHRs and ≈40% to ≈50% with nonmammalian GnRHRs.
 Interestingly, bfGnRHR-2 has an 85% amino acid homology with
 Xenopus GnRHR. Less than 53% amino acid identity
 was observed among the three bfGnRHRs. All isolated cDNAs encode
 functional receptors because their transient expression in COS-7 cells
 resulted in a ligand-dependent increase in inositol phosphate
 production. Notably, all three receptors exhibited a differential
 ligand selectivity. For all receptors, cGnRH-II has a higher potency
 than mGnRH. In addition, salmon GnRH also has a strikingly high potency
 to stimulate all three receptors. In conclusion, we demonstrated the
 presence of three GnRHRs in the bullfrog. Their expression in pituitary
 and brain suggests that bfGnRHRs play an important role in the
 regulation of reproductive functions in the bullfrog.

Plant alkaloids, one of the largest groups of natural
 products, provide many pharmacologically active compounds. Several
 genes in the biosynthetic pathways for scopolamine, nicotine, and
 berberine have been cloned, making the metabolic engineering of these
 alkaloids possible. Expression of two branching-point enzymes was
 engineered: putrescine N-methyltransferase (PMT) in
 transgenic plants of Atropa belladonna and
 Nicotiana sylvestris and (S)-scoulerine
 9-O-methyltransferase (SMT) in cultured cells of
 Coptis japonica and Eschscholzia
 californica. Overexpression of PMT increased the nicotine
 content in N. sylvestris, whereas suppression of
 endogenous PMT activity severely decreased the nicotine
 content and induced abnormal morphologies. Ectopic expression of SMT
 caused the accumulation of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids in E.
 californica. The prospects and limitations of engineering plant
 alkaloid metabolism are discussed.

The enhanced disease resistance 1
 (edr1) mutation of Arabidopsis confers
 resistance to powdery mildew disease caused by the fungus
 Erysiphe cichoracearum. Resistance mediated by the
 edr1 mutation is correlated with induction of several
 defense responses, including host cell death. Double mutant analysis
 revealed that all edr1-associated phenotypes are
 suppressed by mutations that block salicylic acid (SA) perception
 (nim1) or reduce SA production (pad4 and
 eds1). The NahG transgene, which lowers
 endogenous SA levels, also suppressed edr1.
 In contrast, the ein2 mutation did not suppress
 edr1-mediated resistance and associated phenotypes,
 indicating that ethylene and jasmonic acid-induced responses are not
 required for edr1 resistance. The EDR1
 gene was isolated by positional cloning and was found to encode a
 putative MAP kinase kinase kinase similar to CTR1, a negative regulator
 of ethylene responses in Arabidopsis. Taken together,
 these data suggest that EDR1 functions at the top of a MAP kinase
 cascade that negatively regulates SA-inducible defense responses.
 Putative orthologs of EDR1 are present in monocots such as rice and
 barley, indicating that EDR1 may regulate defense responses in a wide
 range of crop species.

The structure of scientific collaboration networks is investigated.
 Two scientists are considered connected if they have authored a paper
 together and explicit networks of such connections are constructed by
 using data drawn from a number of databases, including MEDLINE
 (biomedical research), the Los Alamos e-Print Archive (physics), and
 NCSTRL (computer science). I show that these collaboration networks
 form “small worlds,” in which randomly chosen pairs of scientists
 are typically separated by only a short path of intermediate
 acquaintances. I further give results for mean and distribution of
 numbers of collaborators of authors, demonstrate the presence of
 clustering in the networks, and highlight a number of apparent
 differences in the patterns of collaboration between the fields
 studied.

We propose a scheme for molecule-based information processing by
 combining well-studied spectroscopic techniques and recent results from
 chemical dynamics. Specifically it is discussed how optical transitions
 in single molecules can be used to rapidly perform classical (Boolean)
 logical operations. In the proposed way, a restricted number of states
 in a single molecule can act as a logical gate equivalent to at least
 two switches. It is argued that the four-level scheme can also be used
 to produce gain, because it allows an inversion, and not only a
 switching ability. The proposed scheme is quantum mechanical in that it
 takes advantage of the discrete nature of the energy levels but, we
 here discuss the temporal evolution, with the use of the populations
 only. On a longer time range we suggest that the same scheme could be
 extended to perform quantum logic, and a tentative suggestion, based on
 an available experiment, is discussed. We believe that the pumping can
 provide a partial proof of principle, although this and similar
 experiments were not interpreted thus far in our terms.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae silencing protein Sir2
 is the founding member of a universally conserved family of proteins
 that have been shown to possess NAD-dependent histone deacetylation and
 ADP-ribosylation activities. Here we show that histone deacetylation by
 Sir2 is coupled to cleavage of the high-energy bond that links the
 ADP-ribose moiety of NAD to nicotinamide. Analysis of the NAD cleavage
 products revealed the presence of nicotinamide, ADP-ribose, and a third
 product that appeared to be related to ADP-ribose. With the use of
 label transfer experiments, we show that the acetyl group in the
 histone substrate is transferred to this NAD breakdown product during
 deacetylation, forming a product that we conclude to be
 O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. Detection of this species strongly
 argues for obligate coupling of histone deacetylation to NAD breakdown
 by Sir2. We propose reaction mechanisms that could account for this
 coupling via acetyl-ADP-ribose formation. The unprecedented coupling of
 amide bond cleavage to cleavage of a high-energy bond raises the
 possibility that NAD breakdown by Sir2 plays an important role in
 silencing that is independent of its requirement for deacetylation.

Mutations in the clk-1 gene of the nematode
 Caenorhabditis elegans result in slowed
 development, sluggish adult behaviors, and an increased lifespan. CLK-1
 is a mitochondrial polypeptide with sequence and functional
 conservation from human to yeast. Coq7p, the Saccharomyces
 cerevisiae homologue, is essential for ubiquinone (coenzyme Q
 or Q) synthesis and therefore respiration. However, based on assays of
 respiratory function, it has been reported that the primary defect in
 the C. elegans clk-1 mutants is not in Q biosynthesis.
 How do the clk-1 mutant worms have essentially normal
 rates of respiration, when biochemical studies in yeast suggest a Q
 deficiency? Nematodes are routinely fed Escherichia coli
 strains containing a rich supply of Q. To study the Q synthesized by
 C. elegans, we cultured worms on an E.
 coli mutant that lacks Q and found that clk-1
 mutants display early developmental arrest from eggs, or sterility
 emerging from dauer stage. Provision of Q-replete E.
 coli rescues these defects. Lipid analysis showed that
 clk-1 worms lack the nematode Q9 isoform and
 instead contain a large amount of a metabolite that is slightly more
 polar than Q9. The clk-1 mutants also have
 increased levels of Q8, the E. coli isoform,
 and rhodoquinone-9. These results show that the clk-1
 mutations result in Q auxotrophy evident only when Q is removed from
 the diet, and that the aging and developmental phenotypes previously
 described are consistent with altered Q levels and distribution.

We applied two experiments useful in the study of
 ligand-regulated DNA binding proteins to AraC, the dimeric regulator of
 the Escherichia coli l-arabinose operon. In
 the absence of arabinose, AraC prefers to loop DNA by binding to two
 half-sites that are separated by 210 base pairs, and in the presence of
 arabinose it prefers to bind to adjacently located half-sites. The
 basis for this ligand-regulated shift in binding appears to result from
 a shift in the rigidity of the system, where rigidity both in AraC
 protein in the absence of arabinose, and in the DNA are required to
 generate the free energy differences that produce the binding
 preferences. Eliminating the dimerization domains and connecting the
 two DNA binding domains of AraC by a flexible peptide linker should
 provide a protein whose behavior mimics that of AraC when there is no
 interaction between its dimerization and DNA binding domains. The
 resulting protein bound to adjacent half-sites on the DNA, like AraC
 protein in the presence of arabinose. When the two double-stranded DNA
 half-sites were connected by 24 bases of single-stranded, flexible DNA,
 wild-type AraC protein bound to the DNA in the presence and absence of
 arabinose with equal affinity, showing that AraC modulates its DNA
 binding affinity in response to arabinose by shifting the relative
 positions of its DNA binding domains. These results are consistent with
 the light switch mechanism for the action of AraC, refine the model,
 and extend the range of experimental tests to which it has been
 subjected.

The catalytic mechanism of the reductive half reaction of the
 quinoprotein methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) is believed to proceed either
 through a hemiketal intermediate or by direct transfer of a hydride ion
 from the substrate methyl group to the cofactor, pyrroloquinoline
 quinone (PQQ). A crystal structure of the enzyme-substrate complex of a
 similar quinoprotein, glucose dehydrogenase, has recently been reported
 that strongly favors the hydride transfer mechanism in that enzyme. A
 theoretical analysis and an improved refinement of the 1.9-Å
 resolution crystal structure of MDH from Methylophilus
 methylotrophus W3A1 in the presence of methanol, reported
 earlier, indicates that the observed tetrahedral configuration of the
 C-5 atom of PQQ in that study represents the C-5-reduced form of the
 cofactor and lends support for a hydride transfer mechanism for MDH.

MalT, the specific activator of the maltose regulon, is the
 prototype of a family of high-molecular-mass ATP-binding bacterial
 transcription activators. On binding of its two positive effectors, the
 inducer maltotriose and ATP, MalT oligomerizes to an active state
 competent for promoter binding and transcription activation. In
 addition to its previously known DNA-binding domain, limited
 proteolysis showed that MalT contains three other domains, the
 boundaries of which were accurately delimited by N-terminal
 microsequencing. The N-terminal domain alone binds ATP. Maltotriose
 binding involves an extended region corresponding to domains 2 and 3,
 although weak binding to domain 3 alone was also observed. Moreover,
 maltotriose binding induces a conformational shift involving a movement
 of both domains 1 and 3 with respect to domain 2, leading to the active
 form of the protein. Sequence examination of the MalT homologues
 suggests that these three domains might constitute a signaling module.

Human nuclear RNase P purified from HeLa cells has ATPase activity.
 This activity is associated with one of the protein subunits of the
 enzyme, Rpp20. Thus, human nuclear RNase P, which contains several
 proteins and one essential RNA, has at least one other enzymatic
 activity in addition to cleavage of phosphoester bonds in RNA. The
 amino acid sequence of Rpp20 has a signature motif found in an
 ATPase-containing subunit of a family of protein complexes (ABC
 transporters) that mediate a variety of trans-membrane traffic, as well
 as a segment, DIxxN, that resembles the DEAD box motif of many ATPases:
 together, these might represent an ATPase signature motif.

The carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA
 polymerase II plays an important role in transcription and processing
 of the nascent transcript by interacting with both transcription and
 RNA processing factors. We show here that the
 cleavage/polyadenylation factor IA of Saccharomyces
 cerevisiae directly contacts CTD. First by affinity
 chromatography experiments with yeast extracts we demonstrate that the
 Rna15p, Rna14p, and Pcf11p subunits of this complex are associated with
 phosphorylated CTD. This interaction is confirmed for Rna15p by yeast
 two-hybrid analysis. Second, Pcf11p, but not Rna15p, is shown to
 directly contact phosphorylated CTD based on in vitro
 binding studies with recombinant proteins. These findings establish a
 direct interaction of cleavage/polyadenylation factor IA with the
 CTD. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis of transcription run-on
 performed on temperature-sensitive mutant strains reveals that the lack
 of either functional Rna14p or Pcf11p affects transcription termination
 more severely than the absence of a functional Rna15p. Moreover, these
 data reinforce the concept that CTD phosphorylation acts as a
 regulatory mechanism in the maturation of the primary transcript.

Amino acid–Fe(II)–chelator complexes exhibit strong
 antioxidant activity. Taking advantage of the unique spectral
 characteristics of the complexes formed when Ferrozine (Fz) is used as
 the chelator, we now show that the primary blue complex
 (ɛmax at 632 nm) decomposes by two independent pathways:
 (i) a nonoxidative pathway involving dissociation of the
 amino acid component and formation of a purple complex
 (ɛmax at 562 nm) and (ii) an oxidative
 pathway leading to Fe(III) and colorless products. Quantitative
 conversion of the blue to purple complex yields an isosbestic point
 (i.p.) at 601 nm, whereas no i.p. is formed during quantitative
 oxidation of the blue complex. However, under some experimental
 conditions, decomposition of the blue product occurs by both pathways,
 leading to occurrence of a clean i.p. at wavelengths varying from 601
 to 574 nm. Results of simulation experiments, confirmed by direct
 analysis, demonstrate that shifts in the i.p. reflect differences in
 the fractions of blue compound that decompose by the oxidative and
 nonoxidative pathways. Indeed, the fraction of blue that is converted
 to the purple complex is readily deduced from the wavelength of the
 i.p. These results suggest that identification of a physiological
 chelator that can replace Ferrozine in amino acid–iron complexes might
 have important physiological and pharmacological applications.

Stimulated by recent 13C and 31P NMR
 studies of exercising muscle, we propose a model of the energetics of
 contraction. Previous studies of energetics have followed energy
 consumption. However, the rapidity of contraction, in 10–40 msec,
 requires that energy be delivered rapidly, so that the muscle has power
 requirements of rapid energy expenditure that are ultimately met by the
 slower averaged consumption of carbon and oxygen from blood. We propose
 that energy is supplied in milliseconds by glycogenolysis and that
 between contractions, glycogenesis refills the pools. The energy for
 glycogenesis is supplied by oxidative phosphorylation. This mechanism
 utilizes the rapid conversion of glycogen phosphorylase, the
 “fight-or-flight” enzyme, to its active form. Lactate is
 necessarily generated by this pathway to serve as a time buffer between
 fast and slow energy needs, which resolves the paradoxical generation
 of lactate in well oxygenated tissue. Consequences of the glycogen
 shunt are compatible with numerous biochemical and physiological
 experiments. The model provides a possible mechanism for muscle
 fatigue, suggesting that at low but nonzero glycogen concentrations,
 there is not enough glycogen to supply millisecond energy needs.

The crystal structure of DsRed, a red fluorescent protein
 from a corallimorpharian, has been determined at 2.0-Å
 resolution by multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion and
 crystallographic refinement. Crystals of the
 selenomethionine-substituted protein have space group P21
 and contain a tetramer with 222 noncrystallographic symmetry in the
 asymmetric unit. The refined model has satisfactory stereochemistry and
 a final crystallographic R factor of 0.162. The protein,
 which forms an obligatory tetramer in solution and in the crystal, is a
 squat rectangular prism comprising four protomers whose fold is
 extremely similar to that of the Aequorea victoria green
 fluorescent protein despite low (≈23%) amino acid sequence homology.
 The monomer consists of an 11-stranded β barrel with a coaxial helix.
 The chromophores, formed from the primary sequence -Gln-Tyr-Gly-
 (residues 66–68), are arranged in a ≈27 × 34-Å rectangular
 array in two approximately antiparallel pairs. The geometry at the α
 carbon of Gln-66 (refined without stereochemical restraints) is
 consistent with an sp2 hybridized center, in accord with
 the proposal that red fluorescence is because of an additional
 oxidation step that forms an acylimine extension to the chromophore
 [Gross, L. A., Baird, G. S., Hoffman, R. C., Baldridge,
 K. K. & Tsien, R. Y. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
 USA 87, 11990–11995]. The carbonyl oxygen of Phe-65 is almost
 90° out of the plane of the chromophore, consistent with theoretical
 calculations suggesting that this is the minimum energy conformation of
 this moiety despite the conjugation of this group with the rest of the
 chromophore.

Here we demonstrate the implementation of a single-molecule force
 clamp adapted for use with an atomic force microscope. We show that
 under force-clamp conditions, an engineered titin protein elongates in
 steps because of the unfolding of its modules and that the waiting
 times to unfold are exponentially distributed. Force-clamp measurements
 directly measure the force dependence of the unfolding probability and
 readily captures the different mechanical stability of the I27 and I28
 modules of human cardiac titin. Force-clamp spectroscopy promises to be
 a direct way to probe the mechanical stability of elastic proteins such
 as those found in muscle, the extracellular matrix, and cell adhesion.

It has generally been considered that important biological effects
 of ionizing radiation arise as a direct consequence of DNA damage
 occurring in irradiated cells. We have examined this hypothesis by
 exposing cells to very low fluences of α-particles, similar to those
 emitted by radon gas, such that as few as 1% of the cells in a
 population are traversed by a particle and thus receive any radiation
 exposure. By using the endpoints of changes in gene expression and
 induction of DNA damage, we show that nonirradiated “bystander”
 cells participate in the overall response of confluent
 density-inhibited populations of cultured fibroblast and epithelial
 cells. By in situ immunofluorescence techniques and the
 use of cells genetically compromised in their ability to perform gap
 junction intercellular communication, we present direct evidence for
 the involvement of connexin43-mediated intercellular communication in
 the transmission of damage signals to nonirradiated cells. Induction of
 the stress-inducible p21Waf1 protein in aggregates of
 neighboring cells far exceeding the fraction of cells whose nucleus has
 been traversed occurred in gap junction-competent cells only. These
 changes in p21Waf1 expression correlated with both the
 induction of DNA damage (as measured by micronucleus formation) as well
 as increased Ser-15 phosphorylation of p53.

Understanding of the chemical nature of the dioxygen moiety
 of oxyhemoglobin is crucial for elucidation of its physiological
 function. In the present work, direct Raman spectroscopic observation
 of both the Fe—O2 and O—O stretching modes
 unambiguously establishes the vibrational characteristics of the
 oxygen-bound heme moiety in the hemoglobins of Chlamydomonas
 eugametos and Synechocystis PCC6803. In addition
 to providing the resonance Raman assignment of the O—O stretching
 mode (1136 cm−1 for Chlamydomonas, 1133
 cm−1 for Synechocystis) in an oxyhemoglobin
 with an iron-porphyrin, this study also reports unusually low
 frequencies for the Fe—O2 stretching modes (554
 cm−1). The effect of strong hydrogen bonding to the bound
 oxygen is confirmed by changes in the frequency of the
 Fe—O2 stretching mode on mutation of distal residues.
 These findings suggest an enzymatic function rather than an oxygen
 transport role for these hemoglobins.

Transferred DNA (T-DNA) transfer from Agrobacterium
 tumefaciens into eukaryotic cells is the only known example of
 interkingdom DNA transfer. T-DNA is a single-stranded segment of
 Agrobacterium's tumor-inducing plasmid that enters the
 plant cell as a complex with the bacterial virulence proteins VirD2 and
 VirE2. The VirE2 protein is highly induced on contact of A.
 tumefaciens with a plant host and has been reported to act in
 late steps of transfer. One of its previously demonstrated functions is
 binding to the single-stranded (ss) T-DNA and protecting it from
 degradation. Recent experiments suggest other functions of the protein.
 A combination of planar lipid bilayer experiments, vesicle swelling
 assays, and DNA transport experiments demonstrated that VirE2 can
 insert itself into artificial membranes and form channels. These
 channels are voltage gated, anion selective, and single-stranded
 DNA-specific and can facilitate the efficient transport of
 single-stranded DNA through membranes. These experiments demonstrate a
 VirE2 function as a transmembrane DNA transporter, which could have
 applications in gene delivery systems.

Ankyrin is a cytoskeletal adaptor protein that controls important
 cellular functions, including Ca2+ efflux at inositol
 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) on the endoplasmic
 reticulum. The present study found that sigma-1 receptors (Sig-1R),
 unique endoplasmic reticulum proteins that bind certain steroids,
 neuroleptics, and psychotropic drugs, form a trimeric complex with
 ankyrin B and IP3R type 3 (IP3R-3) in NG-108
 cells. The trimeric complex could be coimmunoprecipitated by antibodies
 against any of the three proteins. Sig-1R agonists such as pregnenolone
 sulfate and cocaine caused the dissociation of an ankyrin B isoform
 (ANK 220) from IP3R-3. This effect caused by Sig-1R
 agonists was blocked by a Sig-1R antagonist. The degree of dissociation
 of ANK 220 from IP3R-3 caused by Sig-1R ligands correlates
 excellently with the ligands' efficacies in potentiating the
 bradykinin-induced increase in cytosolic free Ca2+
 concentration. Immunocytohistochemistry showed that Sig-1R, ankyrin B,
 and IP3R-3 are colocalized in NG-108 cells in perinuclear
 areas and in regions of cell-to-cell communication. These results
 suggest that Sig-1R and associated ligands may play important roles in
 cells by controlling the function of cytoskeletal proteins and that the
 Sig-1R/ANK220/IP3R-3 complex regulating
 Ca2+ signaling may represent a site of action for
 neurosteroids and cocaine.

 programmed by plasmid DNA encoding cyclin B. Several findings indicate
 that the cleavage activity in this assay is provided by the bacterial
 protease OmpT, which cofractionates with cyclin B and
 p27KIP1 plasmid DNAs and is thus carried over into the
 coupled in vitro transcription/translation reactions.
 (i) Cleavage activity appeared even when transcription
 or translation of the cyclin B or p27KIP1 was blocked.
 (ii) Activity resembling OmpT, a serine protease that
 cleaves between dibasic residues, routinely copurifies with
 p27KIP1 and cyclin B plasmid DNAs. (iii)
 Both cyclin A cleavage activity and OmpT activity are heat stable,
 resistant to denaturation, and inhibited by Zn2+,
 Cu2+, or benzamidine. (iv) Cyclin A cleavage
 activity is detected when using lysates or DNAs prepared from
 Escherichia coli strains that contained OmpT but not
 with strains lacking OmpT. (v) Purified OmpT enzyme
 itself cleaves cyclin A at R70/R71. These data indicate that OmpT can
 be present in certain DNA preparations obtained by using standard
 plasmid purification protocols, and its presence can potentially affect
 the outcome and interpretation of studies carried out using in
 vitro-translated proteins.

We have identified a family of resistin-like molecules (RELMs) in
 rodents and humans. Resistin is a hormone produced by fat cells.
 RELMα is a secreted protein that has a restricted tissue distribution
 with highest levels in adipose tissue. Another family member, RELMβ,
 is a secreted protein expressed only in the gastrointestinal tract,
 particularly the colon, in both mouse and human. RELMβ gene
 expression is highest in proliferative epithelial cells and is markedly
 increased in tumors, suggesting a role in intestinal proliferation.
 Resistin and the RELMs share a cysteine composition and other signature
 features. Thus, the RELMs together with resistin comprise a class of
 tissue-specific signaling molecules.

Apolipoprotein E (apoE) secreted by macrophages in the artery
 wall exerts an important protective effect against the development of
 atherosclerosis, presumably through its ability to promote lipid
 efflux. Previous studies have shown that increases in cellular free
 cholesterol levels stimulate apoE transcription in macrophages and
 adipocytes; however, the molecular basis for this regulation is
 unknown. Recently, Taylor and colleagues [Shih, S. J., Allan, C.,
 Grehan, S., Tse, E., Moran, C. & Taylor, J. M. (2000)
 J. Biol. Chem. 275, 31567–31572] identified two
 enhancers from the human apoE gene, termed multienhancer 1 (ME.1) and
 multienhancer 2 (ME.2), that direct macrophage- and adipose-specific
 expression in transgenic mice. We demonstrate here that the nuclear
 receptors LXRα and LXRβ and their oxysterol ligands are key
 regulators of apoE expression in both macrophages and adipose tissue.
 We show that LXR/RXR heterodimers regulate apoE transcription
 directly, through interaction with a conserved LXR response element
 present in both ME.1 and ME.2. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
 ability of oxysterols and synthetic ligands to regulate apoE expression
 in adipose tissue and peritoneal macrophages is reduced in
 Lxrα−/− or Lxrβ−/− mice and
 abolished in double knockouts. Basal expression of apoE is not
 compromised in Lxr null mice, however, indicating that
 LXRs mediate lipid-inducible rather than tissue-specific expression of
 this gene. Together with our previous work, these findings support a
 central role for LXR signaling pathways in the control of macrophage
 cholesterol efflux through the coordinate regulation of apoE, ABCA1,
 and ABCG1 expression.

The proteasome is the primary protease used by cells for degrading
 proteins and generating peptide ligands for class I molecules of the
 major histocompatibility complex. Based on the properties of cells
 adapted to grow in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor
 4-hydroxy-5-iodo-3-nitrophenylacetyl-Leu-Leu-leucinal-vinyl sulfone
 (NLVS), it was proposed that proteasomes can be replaced by alternative
 proteolytic systems, particularly a large proteolytic complex with a
 tripeptidyl peptidase II activity. Here we show that NLVS-adapted cells
 retain sensitivity to a number of highly specific proteasome inhibitors
 with regard to antigenic peptide generation, accumulation of
 polyubiquitinated proteins, degradation of p53, and cell viability. In
 addition, we show that in the same assays (with a single minor
 exception), NLVS-adapted cells are about as sensitive as nonselected
 cells to Ala-Ala-Phe-chloromethylketone, a specific inhibitor of
 tripeptidyl peptidase II activity. Based on these findings, we conclude
 that proteasomes still have essential proteolytic functions in adapted
 cells that are not replaced by Ala-Ala-Phe-chloromethylketone-sensitive
 proteases.

The G12 subfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins, comprised of the
 α-subunits Gα12 and Gα13, has been implicated as a signaling
 component in cellular processes ranging from cytoskeletal changes to
 cell growth and oncogenesis. In an attempt to elucidate specific roles
 of this subfamily in cell regulation, we sought to identify molecular
 targets of Gα12. Here we show a specific interaction between the G12
 subfamily and the cytoplasmic tails of several members of the cadherin
 family of cell-surface adhesion proteins. Gα12 or Gα13 binding
 causes dissociation of the transcriptional activator β-catenin from
 cadherins. Furthermore, in cells lacking the adenomatous polyposis coli
 protein required for β-catenin degradation, expression of
 mutationally activated Gα12 or Gα13 causes an increase in
 β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation. These findings provide
 a potential molecular mechanism for the previously reported cellular
 transforming ability of the G12 subfamily and reveal a link between
 heterotrimeric G proteins and cellular processes controlling growth and
 differentiation.

Elucidating the genetic basis of adaptation on a genomewide scale
 has evaded biologists, but complete genome sequences and DNA
 high-density array technology make genomewide surveys more tractable.
 Six lines of Escherichia coli adapted for 2,000
 generations to a stressful high temperature of 41.5°C were examined
 on a genomewide scale for duplication/deletion events by using DNA
 high-density arrays. A total of five duplication and deletion events
 were detected. These five events occurred in three of the six lines,
 whereas the remaining three lines contained no detectable events. Three
 of the duplications were at 2.85 Mb of the E. coli
 chromosome, providing evidence for the replicability of the adaptation
 to high temperature. Four candidate genes previously shown to play
 roles in stress and starvation survival were identified in the region
 of common duplication. Expression of the two candidate genes examined
 is elevated over expression levels in the ancestral lines or the lines
 without the duplication. In the two cases where the duplication at 2.85
 Mb has been further characterized, the timing of the genome
 reorganization is coincident with significant increases in relative
 fitness. In both of these cases, the model for the origin of the
 duplication is a complex recombination event involving insertion
 sequences and repeat sequences. These results provide additional
 evidence for the idea that gene duplication plays an integral role
 in adaptation, specifically as a means for gene amplification.

Patterns of nucleotide sequence diversity in the
 predominantly self-fertilizing species Hordeum vulgare
 subspecies spontaneum (wild barley) are compared between
 the putative alcohol dehydrogenase 3 locus (denoted
 “adh3”) and alcohol dehydrogenase 1
 (adh1), two related but unlinked loci. The data consist
 of a sequence sample of 1,873 bp of “adh3” drawn
 from 25 accessions that span the species range. There were 104
 polymorphic sites in the sequenced region of
 “adh3.” The data reveal a strong geographic
 pattern of diversity at “adh3” despite geographic
 uniformity at adh1. Moreover, levels of nucleotide
 sequence diversity differ by nearly an order of magnitude between the
 two loci. Genealogical analysis resolved two distinct clusters of
 “adh3” alleles (dimorphic sequence types) that
 coalesce roughly 3 million years ago. One type consists of accessions
 from the Middle East, and the other consists of accessions
 predominantly from the Near East. The two “adh3”
 sequence types are characterized by a high level of differentiation
 between clusters (≈2.2%), which induces an overall excess of
 intermediate frequency variants in the pooled sample. Finally, there is
 evidence of intralocus recombination in the “adh3”
 data, despite the high level of self-fertilization characteristic of
 wild barley.

DNA from ancient human remains provides perspectives on the origin
 of our species and the relationship between molecular and morphological
 variation. We report analysis of mtDNA from the remains of 10 ancient
 Australians. These include the morphologically gracile
 Lake Mungo 3 [≈60 thousand years (ka) before present] and three
 other gracile individuals from Holocene deposits at
 Willandra Lakes (<10 ka), all within the skeletal range of living
 Australians, and six Pleistocene/early Holocene individuals (15 to
 <8 ka) from Kow Swamp with robust morphologies outside
 the skeletal range of contemporary indigenous Australians. Lake Mungo 3
 is the oldest (Pleistocene) “anatomically modern” human from whom
 DNA has been recovered. His mtDNA belonged to a lineage that only
 survives as a segment inserted into chromosome 11 of the nuclear
 genome, which is now widespread among human populations. This lineage
 probably diverged before the most recent common ancestor of
 contemporary human mitochondrial genomes. This timing of divergence
 implies that the deepest known mtDNA lineage from an anatomically
 modern human occurred in Australia; analysis restricted to living
 humans places the deepest branches in East Africa. The other ancient
 Australian individuals we examined have mtDNA sequences descended from
 the most recent common ancestor of living humans. Our results indicate
 that anatomically modern humans were present in Australia before the
 complete fixation of the mtDNA lineage now found in all living people.
 Sequences from additional ancient humans may further challenge current
 concepts of modern human origins.

Evolution produces complex and structured networks of interacting
 components in chemical, biological, and social systems. We describe a
 simple mathematical model for the evolution of an idealized chemical
 system to study how a network of cooperative molecular species arises
 and evolves to become more complex and structured. The network is
 modeled by a directed weighted graph whose positive and negative links
 represent “catalytic” and “inhibitory” interactions among
 the molecular species, and which evolves as the least populated species
 (typically those that go extinct) are replaced by new ones. A small
 autocatalytic set, appearing by chance, provides the seed for the
 spontaneous growth of connectivity and cooperation in the graph. A
 highly structured chemical organization arises inevitably as the
 autocatalytic set enlarges and percolates through the network in a
 short analytically determined timescale. This self organization does
 not require the presence of self-replicating species. The network also
 exhibits catastrophes over long timescales triggered by the chance
 elimination of “keystone” species, followed by recoveries.

The divergent evolution of protein sequences from genomic
 databases can be analyzed by the use of different mathematical models.
 The most common treat all sites in a protein sequence as equally
 variable. More sophisticated models acknowledge the fact that
 purifying selection generally tolerates variable amounts of amino acid
 replacement at different positions in a protein sequence. In their
 “stationary” versions, such models assume that the replacement
 rate at individual positions remains constant throughout evolutionary
 history. “Nonstationary” covarion versions, however, allow the
 replacement rate at a position to vary in different branches of the
 evolutionary tree. Recently, statistical methods have been developed
 that highlight this type of variation in replacement rates. Here, we
 show how positions that have variable rates of divergence in different
 regions of a tree (“covarion behavior”), coupled with analyses of
 experimental three-dimensional structures, can provide experimentally
 testable hypotheses that relate individual amino acid residues to
 specific functional differences in those branches. We illustrate this
 in the elongation factor family of proteins as a paradigm for
 applications of this type of analysis in functional genomics generally.

T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes are present in jawed vertebrates,
 including cartilaginous fishes, but not in jawless vertebrates or
 invertebrates. The origins of these lineages may be understood in terms
 of evolutionary changes in the structure and regulation of
 transcription factors that control lymphocyte development, such as
 PU.1. The identification and characterization of three members of the
 PU.1 family of transcription factors in a cartilaginous fish,
 Raja eglanteria, are described here. Two of these genes
 are orthologs of mammalian PU.1 and Spi-C, respectively, whereas the
 third gene, Spi-D, is a different family member. In addition, a
 PU.1-like gene has been identified in a jawless vertebrate,
 Petromyzon marinus (sea lamprey). Both DNA-binding and
 transactivation domains are highly conserved between mammalian and
 skate PU.1, in marked contrast to lamprey Spi, in which similarity is
 evident only in the DNA-binding domain. Phylogenetic analysis of
 sequence data suggests that the appearance of Spi-C may predate the
 divergence of the jawed and jawless vertebrates and that Spi-D arose
 before the divergence of the cartilaginous fish from the lineage
 leading to the mammals. The tissue-specific expression patterns of
 skate PU.1 and Spi-C suggest that these genes share regulatory as well
 as structural properties with their mammalian orthologs.

The rat zitter (zi) mutation induces hypomyelination
 and vacuolation in the central nervous system (CNS), which result in
 early-onset tremor and progressive flaccid paresis. By positional
 cloning, we found a marked decrease in Attractin (Atrn)
 mRNA in the brain of the zi/zi rat and
 identified zi as an 8-bp deletion at a splice donor site
 of Atrn. Atrn has been known to play multiple roles in
 regulating physiological processes that are involved in monocyte–T
 cell interaction, agouti-related hair pigmentation, and
 control of energy homeostasis. Rat Atrn gene encoded two
 isoforms, a secreted and a membrane form, as a result of alternative
 splicing. The zi mutation at the Atrn
 locus darkened coat color when introduced into agouti rats, as also
 described in mahogany (mg) mice, carrying the homozygous
 mutation at the Atrn locus. Transgenic rescue
 experiments showed that the membrane-type Atrn
 complemented both neurological alteration and abnormal pigmentation in
 zi/zi rats, but that the secreted-type
 Atrn complemented neither mutant phenotype. Furthermore,
 we discovered that mg mice exhibited hypomyelination and
 vacuolation in the CNS associated with body tremor. We conclude from
 these results that the membrane Atrn has a critical role
 in normal myelination in the CNS and would provide insights into the
 physiology of myelination as well as the etiology of myelin diseases.

CpG islands are important in the protection of adjacent
 housekeeping genes from de novo DNA methylation and for
 keeping them in a transcriptionally active state. However, little is
 known about their capacity to protect heterologous genes and assure
 position-independent transcription of adjacent transgenes or retroviral
 vectors. To tackle this question, we have used the mouse
 aprt CpG island to flank a Rous sarcoma virus
 (RSV)-derived reporter vector and followed the transcriptional activity
 of integrated vectors. RSV is an avian retrovirus which does not
 replicate in mammalian cells because of several blocks at all levels of
 the replication cycle. Here we show that our RSV-derived reporter
 proviruses linked to the mouse aprt gene CpG island
 remain undermethylated and keep their transcriptional activity after
 stable transfection into both avian and nonpermissive mammalian cells.
 This effect is most likely caused by the protection from de
 novo methylation provided by the CpG island and not by
 enhancement of the promoter strength. Our results are consistent with
 previous finding of CpG islands in proximity to active but not inactive
 proviruses and support further investigation of the protection of the
 gene transfer vectors from DNA methylation.

The level of polyteny of the Drosophila salivary
 gland chromosomes was determined throughout the chromosome region
 89E1–4, the locus of the Bithorax Complex. A zone of
 underreplication spans the 300 kb of DNA from the Ubx to
 Abd-B loci. From the centromere proximal end of the
 complex, a 70-kb-long gradual decrease of polytenization starts with
 the Ubx transcription unit and, after a floor
 corresponding to the abd-A locus, raises gradually back
 to the maximum over 70 kb in the region of the Abd-B
 transcription unit. In flies carrying the mutation Suppressor of
 DNA Underreplication [Su(UR)ES], the
 underreplication of the Bithorax Complex is fully
 suppressed. In the wild type, the Bithorax Complex forms
 a weak point featuring thinner bands separated by clefts or
 constrictions. In Su(UR)ES strain in contrast, the
 89E1–4 band looks like a single solid band consisting of homogenous
 dense material. We speculate that the wild-type Su(UR)ES protein
 hampers DNA replication of silenced domains and leads to their
 underreplication in salivary gland polytene chromosomes.

Mutations in several genes encoding transcription factors of
 the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) cascade are associated with
 maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), a monogenic form of
 early-onset diabetes mellitus. The ability of the orphan nuclear
 receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) to modulate the
 transcriptional activity of MODY1 protein, the nuclear receptor
 HNF-4α, suggested SHP as a candidate MODY gene. We screened 173
 unrelated Japanese subjects with early-onset diabetes for mutations in
 this gene and found five different mutations (H53fsdel10,
 L98fsdel9insAC, R34X, A195S, and R213C) in 6 subjects as well as one
 apparent polymorphism (R216H), all present in the heterozygous state.
 Interestingly, all of the subjects with the mutations were mildly or
 moderately obese at onset of diabetes, and analysis of the lineages of
 these individuals indicated that the SHP mutations were associated with
 obesity rather than with diabetes. Therefore, an additional group of
 101 unrelated nondiabetic subjects with early-onset obesity was
 screened for mutations in the SHP gene. Two of the previously observed
 mutations (R34X and A195S) and two additional mutations (R57W and
 G189E) were identified in 6 subjects, whereas no mutations were
 identified in 116 young nondiabetic lean controls
 (P = 0.0094). Functional studies of the mutant
 proteins show that the mutations result in the loss of SHP
 activity. These results suggest that genetic variation in the SHP gene
 contributes to increased body weight and reveal a pathway leading to
 this common metabolic disorder in Japanese.

We describe here a system for the rapid identification, assay
 development, and characterization of gene-based single nucleotide
 polymorphisms (SNPs). This system couples informatics tools that mine
 candidate SNPs from public expressed sequence tag resources and
 automatically designs assay reagents with detection by a chip-based
 matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
 spectrometry platform. As a proof of concept of this system, a
 genomewide collection of reagents for 9,115 gene-based SNP genetic
 markers was rapidly developed and validated. These data provide
 preliminary insights into patterns of polymorphism in a genomewide
 collection of gene-based polymorphisms.

Bipolar disorder or manic depressive illness is a major psychiatric
 disorder that is characterized by fluctuation between two abnormal mood
 states. Mania is accompanied by symptoms of euphoria, irritability, or
 excitation, whereas depression is associated with low mood and
 decreased motivation and energy. The etiology is currently unknown;
 however, numerous family, twin, and adoption studies have argued for a
 substantial genetic contribution. We have conducted a genome survey of
 bipolar disorder using 443 microsatellite markers in a set of 20
 families from the general North American population to identify
 possible susceptibility loci. A maximum logarithm of odds score of 3.8
 was obtained at D22S278 on 22q. Positive scores were found spanning a
 region of nearly 32 centimorgans (cM) on 22q, with a possible secondary
 peak at D22S419. Six other chromosomal regions yielded suggestive
 evidence for linkage: 3p21, 3q27, 5p15, 10q, 13q31-q34, and 21q22. The
 regions on 22q, 13q, and 10q have been implicated in studies of
 schizophrenia, suggesting the possible presence of susceptibility genes
 common to both disorders.

We hypothesize that loss of imprinting (LOI) of the insulin-like
 growth factor II (IGF2) gene is associated with a
 predisposition to sporadic colorectal cancer. We confirmed a previously
 known strong correlation between LOI and microsatellite instability and
 showed that LOI was not a consequence of microsatellite instability or
 mismatch repair deficiency. LOI of IGF2 correlated
 strongly with biallelic hypermethylation of a core of five CpG sites in
 the insulator region of IGF2/H19, which is a known
 CTCF-binding element. As this methylation-dependent LOI was present in
 both tumors and normal colonic mucosa, it is possible that
 hypermethylation creates a field defect predisposing to cancer.

Recent advances in the ability to detect people at the early
 stages of HIV infection now permit the initiation of antiretroviral
 treatment before the full complement of antiviral immune responses has
 evolved. However, the influence of early treatment interventions on the
 developing anti-HIV immune response is unknown. This study investigates
 the impact of standard highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)
 during the primary stages of HIV infection on the plasma HIV-1 RNA
 level, CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte counts, and the
 CD8+ cell anti-HIV response. Individuals treated with HAART
 within 6 months of infection showed dramatic and rapid reductions in
 HIV-1 RNA levels along with modest increases in CD4+ cell
 number and decreases in CD8+ cell numbers. A significant
 reduction in the level of CD8+ cell noncytotoxic
 suppression of HIV replication was observed over time in most
 participants receiving HAART. Importantly, those individuals choosing
 not to receive therapy maintained low but detectable HIV-1 RNA levels
 and showed no reduction in their CD8+ cell antiviral
 response. These results suggest that either continued antigenic
 challenge is required to sustain CD8+ cell-mediated
 anti-HIV activity, or that HAART has some inhibitory effect on this
 important immunologic function during the early stages of infection.
